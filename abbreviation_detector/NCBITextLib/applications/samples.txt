1|A series of nine overlapping glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins designated B2-1 to B2-9 (ref. 30), spanning the entire coding region of BRCA2, were used to define the regions of BRCA2 that interact with RAD51 (Fig. 1a).
1|The phosphorylation of TR2 was particularly interesting because the RAD51 interaction domain maps exclusively to TR2, as determined by pull-down assays (Fig. 2b, lane 3).
1|Using cells stably expressing GST&amp;#8722;B2-9, we found that decreased S3291 phosphorylation caused by ionizing radiation was associated with a doubling in ability to bind RAD51 (Fig. 4c).

1|we coexpressed HA-parkin with FL-UbcH7 or FL-Ubc7, both of which are known to bind to parkin (Shimura et al 2000; Imai et al, 2001). Almost the same amounts of UbcH7 (Figure 4A) and Ubc7 (Figure 4B) were detected in the anti-parkin immunoprecipitants irrespective of cotransfection with Myc-14-3-3eta.
1|Subsequently, we measured the binding affinities of parkin and alpha-SN for 14-3-3eta by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method. As shown in Figure 5E, parkin bound 14-3-3eta with a considerably strong affinity (Kd=4.2 nM, upper), whereas the affinity of alpha-SN for 14-3-3eta was much lower than that of parkin (Kd=1.1 muM, lower).
1|FL-parkin or its derivatives on the beads were further incubated with cell lysates that expressed Myc-14-3-3eta, and then the amounts of Myc-14-3-3eta bound to the beads were determined (Figure 2B).
1|As shown in Figure 5B (top panel), FL-parkin was self-ubiquitylated in the absence of 14-3-3eta. Coexpression of 14-3-3eta inhibited the self-ubiquitylation of parkin, and this was accompanied by the binding of 14-3-3eta to FL-parkin.
1|We then investigated whether the interaction of 14-3-3eta and parkin is direct or indirect by using purified recombinant His-parkin and GST-14-3-3eta. GST or GST-14-3-3eta was mixed with His-parkin, and pulled down by glutathione beads. His-parkin bound to GST-14-3-3eta, but not GST (Figure 5D, left panel), indicating that parkin directly interacts with 14-3-3eta.
1|When V5-tagged synphilin-1, a known parkin substrate (Chung et al, 2001), was transfected with FL-parkin and HA-ubiquitin in the cells, V5-synphilin-1 was found in ubiquitylated form, as demonstrated by the poly-ubiquitin chain formation (detected by anti-HA antibody) in anti-V5 immunoprecipitant (Figure 3C, top panel).
1|We examined whether parkin is coimmunoprecipitated with anti-14-3-3eta antibody and found parkin in the 14-3-3eta immunoprecipitant (Figure 1C).
1|Parkin was immunoprecipitated from mouse brain extracts, and the presence of 14-3-3 was analyzed by Western blotting (Figure 1A).
1|Coexpression of alpha-SN resulted in the recovery of ubiquitylation of synphilin-1 and the association of synphilin-1 with parkin, suggesting that alpha-SN abrogates the 14-3-3eta-induced suppression of parkin (Figure 5A, top panel).
1|o confirm the specific interaction of parkin with 14-3-3eta, Myc-tagged 14-3-3eta, sigma, beta, or zeta was cotransfected with FLAG (FL)-parkin into HEK293 cells, and their interactions were tested. FL-parkin was detected in the immunoprecipitant of Myc-14-3-3eta, but not those of Myc-14-3-3sigma, beta, and zeta (Figure 1D).
1|First, we examined the self-ubiquitylation of parkin, whose activity was observed by cotransfections of HA-ubiquitin and FL-parkin. Myc-14-3-3eta almost completely suppressed the self-ubiquitylation activity of parkin, while Myc-14-3-3sigma, beta, and zeta had no inhibitory effect (Figure 3B)
1|We also tested the interaction of Myc-14-3-3eta with FL-alpha-SN, FL-alpha-SN(A30P), and FL-alpha-SN(A53T). Myc-14-3-3eta interacted only with FL-alpha-SN, but not alpha-SN(A30P) nor alpha-SN(A53T) (Figure 5C, upper-top panel).

1|ADAMTS13 was incubated at 37 &#176;C with either VWF76, VWF115, or VWF115-A3 in the presence of physiological concentrations of Ca2 and NaCl. Sub-samples were stopped between 0 and 6 h and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining to give a qualitative assessment of each reaction (Fig. 2, A&#150;C). In each case, only the full-length substrate band was visible at 0 h. Thereafter, the intensity of this band diminished and two smaller cleavage product bands appeared. In each case, these bands corresponded to the predicted molecular masses of fragments generated following cleavage at the Tyr1605&#150;Met1606 bond. N-terminal sequencing was performed upon the smallest cleavage product and confirmed that proteolysis had occurred between the Tyr1605&#150;Met1606 bond. Visually, VWF76, VWF115, and VWF115-A3 appeared to be proteolyzed by ADAMTS13 at similar rates. Parallel samples were also analyzed by HPLC. The resolution of the full-length substrate from the two cleavage fragments (peaks 1 and 2) arising from proteolysis (Fig. 2) of each different substrate allowed precise quantification of the extent of cleavage at each time point
1|For separate determination of the catalytic efficiency of VWF115, repeated time course experiments were performed using low substrate concentrations (250 &#150;500 nM). Repeated time course experiments (n 8) gave a mean value of 7.83  104 M1 s1 for kcat/Km (Table 1). Confirmation of the pseudo-first order conditions was obtained by deriving the same kcat/Km value for VWF115 proteolysis at both 250 and 500 nM. Determination of kcat/Km for VWF76 and VWF115-A3 gave values of 6.39  104 M1 s1 and 6.70  104 M1 s1, respectively (Table 1). These kinetic data confirmed that the VWFA3 domain does not significantly contribute to the rate of A2 domain proteolysis, despite containing an ADAMTS13 binding site (18). The contribution of each selected charged amino acid to VWF proteolysis was assessed by determination of the catalytic efficiency of all the mutant VWF115 substrates at 500 nM(Fig. 4Cand Table 1). The rate of proteolysis of the R1583A mutant was not significantly different from that of VWF115, suggesting that this residue is not important for cleavage. Mutation of Glu1638 and Glu1640 induced a mild (2&#150;3-fold) reduction in catalytic efficiency. The most affected (12-fold reduction) single mutant was D1587A, the kcat/Km of which was 0.640.10104M1   s1. The kcat/Km for K1617A, D1614A, and E1615A, which are predicted to lie on the same surface-exposed loop, were 1.90, 1.36, and 1.13104  M1 s1, respectively. These results implied that this loop might play an important role in the cleavage reaction. Consequently, we generated a triple mutant DEK1614/5/7AAA) containing all 3 residues substituted for alanine. Whereas individually these mutations caused a 4&#150;7-fold reduction in kcat/Km, in combination the catalytic efficiency was 13- fold less than wild-type VWF115, implying that the amino acids in this charged loop may act in synergy
1|this approach also served to ascertain whether the most affected charged residue mutants (D1587A, D1614A, E1615A) induced gross structural changes. Despite using increased concentrations of ADAMTS13 (16.5 nM) in the absence of a denaturant, the intact wildtype A2 domain was proteolyzed very slowly, as visualized by gel staining (Fig. 5A), when compared with the A2 domain fragments VWF115, VWF76, and VWF115-A3. When samples containing 500 nM VWFA2 were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 5C), it was clear that the cleavage reaction did not proceed toward completion (28% after 5 h), as previously reported (13). The D1587A, D1614A, and E1615A VWFA2 mutants were proteolyzed either at a similar or slower rate (Fig. 5, A and C), suggesting that these mutations do not alter the A2 domain structure markedly. Under denaturing conditions (1 M urea), the wild-type VWFA2 was proteolyzed faster, although it still did not reach completion (50% after 5 h) (Fig. 5, B and D). Although all the mutants were cleaved at a higher rate under denaturing conditions, they were cleaved appreciably slower than VWFA2, corroborating the direct influence of these mutations upon VWF115 proteolysis.
1|we performed SPR analysis. Monoclonal antibody-mediated orientation-specific coupling of either VWF115 or ADAMTS13 to the sensor chip was not possible due to the relatively fast off-rates of these molecules with the available antibodies to each ligand (not shown). Consequently, we covalently bound either VWF115 or ADAMTS13 to the sensor chip by amine coupling. With VWF115 bound to the chip and ADAMTS13 injected over the sensor, we monitored a concentration-dependent binding response indicative of a high affinity interaction (KD, 20 nM) for this interaction (Fig. 6, inset). Determination of both the association and dissociation rates for the ADAMTS13-VWF115 interaction (n 3) demonstrated a slow off-rate (1.72  103 s1), which would appear to   be the major determinant for the high affinity binding. A second approach, in which ADAMTS13 was coupled to the sensor chip and varying concentrations of VWF115 injected, gave a similar high affinity binding component (KD  15 nM, not shown). These data demonstrate that the affinity of ADAMTS13 for VWF115 is significantly higher than is suggested by the Km for VWF115 proteolysis. SPR analysis of VWF115 mutants (D1587A, D1614A, E1615A, and DEK1614/5/7AAA) using both binding approaches revealed a markedly reduced affinity of ADAMTS13 for each of the mutants when compared with wild-type VWF115 (Fig. 6). Because of the low binding response measured, an accurate KD could not be derived from the VWF115 mutant data. Despite the poor fitting the estimate for the KD for the DEK1614/5/7AAA mutant was 1.3 M. It was clear that for each variant the binding with ADAMTS13 was appreciably compromised and thus the likely cause of their reduced specificity constants.

1|point mutations in the catalytic core of both hdac domains (HD1/2m) completely abolished the HDAC and the TDAC activities of HDAC-6. Surprisingly, mutating either of the hdac catalytic cores (HD1m or HD2m) also destroyed the whole activity on both substrates. This suggests that the cooperation between the two hdac catalytic cores is critical for the deacetylation reaction mediated by HDAC-6. Interestingly, the mutations in the presumed substrate recognition region (7) led to somewhat different effects on enzymatic activities. The mutation in the second substrate recognition site (L798A) completely inactivated the catalytic activity on both peptides, whereas the mutation of the corresponding region in the first hdac domain (L402A) retained partial activity
1|His6-tagged HDAC-6 proteins could be purified as single protein and equal amount of wild type and mutant proteins were used for activity assays (Fig. 1C, left panel). As shown in Fig. 1C, right panel, the HDAC and TDAC activity of HDAC-6 is intrinsic and requires both intact catalytic cores.

1|EMSA was used to verify that the core sequence responsible for NF-kappaB binding resides in the BCL10 or I-kappa-Balpha gene.
1|The possible interaction between Bcl10 and Akt1 was identified by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blotting.

0|the BIR1 domain of cIAP1 is necessary and sufficient for interaction with TRAF2.
1|In contrast, SMAC co-immunoprecipitated with all cIAP1 fragments that contained BIR3 while failing to associate with all cIAP1 fragments lacking BIR3 (Fig. 2A)
1|However, SMAC did co-immunoprecipitate with full-length XIAP and with all fragments of XIAP containing BIR3.
1|First, we used the GST pulldown method to compare the ability of cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP to bind TRAF2 in vitro, employing fragments of cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP comprised of the three tandem BIR domains and using L-[35S]methioninelabeled TRAF2 prepared by in vitro translation (Fig. 3A).
1|FLAGcIAP1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody, and associated TRAF2 (and SMAC) were detected by immunoblotting.
1|TRAF2 binding to FLAG-cIAP1 (first panel) or GST- cIAP2 BIR1 (second panel) was examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (IB) with antibodies against TRAF2. Themembranewas also probed with an anti-SMAC antibody
1|These mutant BIR1 proteins were then expressed as Myctagged proteins in HEK293T cells and assessed for their ability to bind endogenous TRAF2 present in the cell lysates by co-immunoprecipitation assay.
1|To verify that the E64 and R65 mutations directly affect BIR1-TRAF2 association, we used cIAP2 instead of cIAP1, and we produced recombinant single mutant E64R and double mutant E64A/R65A BIR1 proteins in bacteria and examined their interaction with TRAF2 in vitro.
1|For these experiments, wild-type cIAP1 and mutants of cIAP1 were expressed with FLAG tags in HEK293T cells, and their ability to bind mature SMAC protein present within detergent lysates was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting.

1|As shown in Fig. 1A, a sIL-15RIL-2 fusion protein produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and consisting of the entire IL-15R extracellular domain linked to a molecule of human IL-2 (used as a tag for purification) bound IL-15 with high affinity (kon  3.7  105 M1 s1;koff  1.4  105 s1; Kd  38 pM).
1|A similar construction linking the sushi domain of IL-15R to human IL-2 also bound IL-15 (Fig. 1B) but with a 10-fold lower affinity, mainly due to a more rapid off rate (kon  3.1  105 M1 s1; koff  1.3  104 s1; Kd  420 pM).
1|A soluble sushi domain was also produced in E. coli. This sIL-15R-sushi also bound IL-15 with a lower affinity (kon  2.5  105 M1 s1; koff  3.8  104  s1; Kd1.5 nM) (Fig. 1C).

1|When examined by quasi-elastic laser light scattering, the PrP82&#150;146 &#147;flowing solution&#148; contained species with an average hydrodynamic radius (RH, by cumulant analysis) of 250 nm.Multiexponential analysis of the correlation function decay (Fig. 2A) showed that most of these species (99% by number) had average RH  12 nm, corresponding to small oligomers.

1|The ultrastructural examination of the solution used for PrP82&#150;146 immobilization on the sensor chip disclosed that most of the materials aggregated in a loose meshwork of little chains formed by small roundshaped particles having a diameter of 19  7 nm (range 8&#150;52 nm; Fig.1c). Moreover electron microscopy analysis disclosed the presence of a few straight, short filaments with a diameter of 5.5 nm, whereas no fibrils were detected.
1|SDS-PAGE on both the PrP82&#150;146 solutions, without any irradiation, showed monomers to trimers (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6).
1|When the PrP82&#150;146 solutions were irradiated to covalently crosslink preaggregated peptides, higher order species became apparent
1|Most of the PrP82&#150;146 in the solution used for immobilization is assembled in species that remain at the top of the gel (&#147;heavy forms&#148;; Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8).Only low order species (1&#150;5-mers) were detected after irradiation of the PrP82&#150;146 freshly diluted in HBS (i.e. the solution injected over the immobilized peptide in SPR studies).
1|Binding to this empty cell is much lower than to the PrP82-146-coated cell and tends to zero after 15&#150;20 min of dissociation. This indicates that the injected peptide does not bind to the chip matrix and that the binding measured in Fc2 is due to binding to immobilized PrP82-146 (i.e. no new seeds are generated).
1|This shape was seen in the peptide-coated flow cell and in the empty cell, suggesting that the PrP82&#150;146 prefibrillar aggregates, unlike PrP82&#150;146 small oligomers, concentrate on the chip matrix, quite likely by weak electrostatic forces. Despite this &#147;preconcentration&#148; on the sensor surface, the specific binding of these aggregates to immobilized structures (obtained by subtracting the signal in the empty cell) was much smaller than the signal obtained after injection of 20 M of the  small PrP82&#150;146 oligomers (Fig. 6B).
1|Much lower binding levels were also found when PrP82&#150;146 was injected on flow cells in which PrP82&#150;146scr or A42 prefibrillar aggregates had been immobilized (Fig. 4); furthermore PrP82&#150;146 binding to PrP82&#150;146scr and A42 dissociated rapidly and completely

1|The binding to this immobilized IgA2 of SSL7 at different concentrations was recorded (Fig. 1B) after 3000 s when equilibrium was being approached. Plotting the equilibrium binding responses fitted best to a single binding site with an apparent affinity of 5.01.5 nM(n   5, Fig. 1C, one representative experiment KD  6.8  0.8 nM).
1|The binding of biotinylated rSSL7 to WT IgA fusion protein was readily detectable (Fig. 4B, MFI  350  40, n  4). In contrast, the level of binding of SSL7 to the A442R mutant IgA Fc fusion protein (MFI  4.5  0.2) was indistinguishable from the binding to the mock-trans-fected cells (MFI  4.3  0.2). It is notable that an experiment with higher surface expression of IgA Fc fusion protein (Fig. 2), with correspondingly higher SSL7 binding to the WT (Fig. 2B, MFI  980  21), did reveal some low level binding of SSL7 to the A442R mutant protein (MFI  8.4  0.4, 0.15% relative to WT 100%, mock MFI  6.9  0.3). The greatly reduced SSL7 binding paralleled the reduced binding of the FcRI-Ig fusion protein, which bound surface-expressed WT IgA Fc (MFI  29.2  0.2) but not the A442R mutant (MFI  6.5  0.5, mock MFI  6.5  0.1 (Fig. 4C)).

1|Transfection of PS1 increased the amount of -catenin that could be precipitated with wild-type Tcf-4, but the increase was only very modest with Tcf-4 S60E (Fig. 6C). Better PS1 stimulation was observed when binding of Tcf-4 to plakoglobin was analyzed. Surprisingly, PS1 also up-regulated binding of plakoglobin to Tcf-4 S60E,
1|The possibility that inhibition was related to the interaction of -catenin with PS1 was also investigated. Both proteins were co-immunoprecipitated either in SW-480 cells or in RWP1 cells
1|The possibility that inhibition was related to the interaction of -catenin with PS1 was also investigated. Both proteins were co-immunoprecipitated either in SW-480 cells or in RWP1 cells (Fig. 3). We detected that PS1 also interacted with the -catenin homologue plakoglobin in both cell lines.
1|Transfection of PS1 increased the amount of -catenin that could be precipitated with wild-type Tcf-4, but the increase was only very modest with Tcf-4 S60E (Fig. 6C). Better PS1 stimulation was observed when binding of Tcf-4 to plakoglobin was analyzed.
1|Pulldown assays using fragments of Tcf-4 fused to GST indicated that PS1 interacted through the same regions used by -catenin and plakoglobin, amino acids 1&#150;50 and 51&#150;80, respectively (Fig. 6B). Preincubation with either -catenin or plakoglobin increased the amount of PS1 retained by glutathione-Sepharose, suggesting that these proteins mediate the interaction of PS1 and Tcf-4. However, the effect was much stronger when plakoglobin was used (Fig. 6B), suggesting that binding of Tcf-4 to PS1 is mainly mediated by this protein. Moreover, plakoglobin also associated better with Tcf-4 when PS1 was present,
1|As observed in our assays, PS1 migrated in our SDS gels mainly as a band of 50 kDa, suggesting that it was not being processed in our cell lines. To determine whether this modification might alter PS1 binding to Tcf-4 and plakoglobin, we analyzed cellular extracts from cell lines in which PS1 was predominantly present in the processed form. As shown in Fig. 9, when binding of processed and unprocessed forms of PS1 to GST fusion proteins was analyzed, the PS1 carboxyl-terminal fragment bound with lower affinity to -catenin (5-fold lower, Fig. 9B) and plakoglobin (3-fold) than the 50-kDa form. Binding to Tcf-4 was barely detectable for the processed PS1
0|The mechanism involved in stimulation of plakoglobin-Tcf-4 association by PS1 was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 6D, the armadillo repeat domain binds to Tcf-4 with a higher affinity than the full-length protein
1|PS1 associated with armadillo repeats 7&#150;12 to the same extent as the complete central domain and with repeats 10&#150;12 only slightly less, indicating that these repeats are the main binding site for PS1 (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, armadillo repeats 1&#150;6 barely interact with PS1. Deletion of the -catenin amino-tail, which strengthens the interaction of the carboxyl- tail with the armadillo domain and reduces the interaction of this element with other-catenin-binding proteins (41), decreases the affinity for PS1 (Fig. 4C). The effects of -catenin point mutants that modify  the interaction with other proteins were also studied. Tyr-654 3 Glu (Y654E), a mutant that mimics the phosphorylation of this residue by epidermal growth factor receptor or other tyrosine kinases, decreases 4-fold the association between -catenin and PS1,
1|The armadillo repeats involved in PS1 binding were identified as 1&#150;6, suggesting that the interaction of PS1 with plakoglobin requires a more amino-terminal part of this domain than in the case of -catenin. This conclusion was reinforced by the fact that mutation of the plakoglobin equivalent resi-due to -catenin Tyr-654, Tyr-643, did not down-regulate PS1 binding but, to the contrary, increased it (Fig. 4F)

1|To examine the binding of beta1-AR-CT to full length MAGI-3 rather than simply the isolated PDZ1 domain, HEK-293 cells were transfected with full-length V5/His-tagged MAGI-3, and pull-down assays were performed using purified GST fusion proteins corresponding to beta1-AR-CT with the terminal Val residue mutated to either Ala, Ile, Met, or Leu (Fig. 2B).
1|We further confirmed the interaction of SphK1 with Fyn by co-immunoprecipitation analysis using purified human recombinant Fyn and [35S]methionine-labeled SphK1, transcribed/translated in an in vitro TNT T7 reticulocyte system (Fig. 5A, upper panel).
0|Fyn interacts with SphK1 and SphK2.
1|As shown in Fig. 5A (lower panel), an antibody to Lyn (lanes 1&#150;3) co-immunoprecipitated [35S]methionine-labeled SphK2 only when both purified human recombinant Lyn and [35S]methionine-labeled SphK2, which was in vitro transcribed/translated, were present.
1|Fyn or Lyn was immunoprecipitated where indicated, and the presence of SphK1 (upper panel) or SphK2 (lower panel) was demonstrated by Western blotting using anti-V5 and anti-SphK2 (Ct), respectively.
1|To verify that the interaction between SphK and Fyn was not an artifact of the in vitro system or the overexpression of these proteins in cells, we tested the association of endogenous SphK2 (Fig. 5C), which was the weaker interacting SphK, with Fyn in BMMC from WT and Fyn-deficient mice.
1|Fyn was immunoprecipitated from nonstimulated or Ag-stimulated (2 min) WT BMMC lysates mixed with lysates from HEK293 cells overexpressing FLAG-SphK2.
1|Following coexpression of HA-tagged Ras mutants with Epac2, Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody, and Epac2 was found to co-precipitate with oncogenic Ras mutants, but not with the closely related M-RasLeu-71 that has an activating mutation equivalent to H-RasLeu-61 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, Kand N-Ras bound more effectively to Epac2 than did H-Ras.Binding to activated H-Ras proteins containing Ser35, Gly37, or Cys40 mutations in their effector-binding loop was diminished (Fig. 2D).

1|in the cytoplasm: the 6-7% intramolecular FRET efficiency of the doubly labeled constructs (CFP-beta1a-YFP or YFP-beta1a-CFP) expressed in dysgenic myotubes indicates that the N and C termini of cytoplasmic beta1a subunits are likely separated by &lt;10 nm. Fourth, within junctions: there was no measurable intermolecular FRET for 1:1 mixtures of CFP-beta1a + YFP-beta1a, beta1a-CFP + beta1a-YFP, or CFP-beta1a + beta1a-YFP expressed in beta-null myotubes. This result is consistent with the idea that then N and C termini of adjacent beta1a subunits are &gt;10 nm apart, which would occur if they were oriented away from the center of tetrads.

1|By using IKK immunocomplex kinase assays with GST-IB as a substrate, we found that TNF evoked increases in IKK activity measured in either anti-IKK or anti-IKK immunoprecipitates of HepG2 cells (Fig. 5A). However, pretreatment with manumycin A blocked both the constitutive and TNFstimulated responses.
1|To determine whether the Cys-179 substitution to Ala (C179A) affected the sensitivity of IKK to manumycin A, epitopetagged human wild-type and mutant IKK proteins from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated and examined for their constitutive autophosphorylation and exogenous kinase activity in vitro (Fig. 5B).

1|To test for direct binding, we expressed and purified recombinant dynamin 1 and performed binding studies using beads loaded with profilin 1 and profilin 2 (Fig. 1B).
1|To identify the exact binding sites of profilin 2 within the PRD and to compare these with the docking sites of other known dynamin 1 ligands we made use of a SPOT peptide array covering the entire PRD.
1|Although we have identified several potential profilin 2 binding sites along the PRD, the question remains whether all these sites are occupied in the profilin 2-dynamin 1 complex. To determine the stoichiometry of the complex in vitro we performed velocity sedimentation using an analytical ultracentrifuge.
1|Vectors expressing N1IC and either p50 or c-Rel were co-transfected into 293T cells and subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with antibodies against specific NF-kappaB subunits. Consistent with earlier reports, we detected direct interaction between N1IC and p50, as well as with c-Rel (Figure 4B).

1|The solution structure of p47phox-(151&#150;286) complexed with p22phox-(149&#150;168) was determined using an ARIA/CNS protocol.
1|Aliquots of each peptide solution were added to the sample solution of the 15N-labeled tandem SH3 domains of p47phox, and the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were analyzed (Fig. 1). We found that many of the signals decreased and finally disappeared as the concentration of p22phox-(149&#150;162) increased (Fig. 1a). Notably, three of five tryptophan signals disappeared, leaving only two observed signals (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 1a). This shows that a structural change occurs in the tandem SH3 domains upon complex formation. This produces an intermediate slow-exchange limit in the NMR spectra so that some signals cannot be observed because of exchange broadening. In contrast, an increase in concentration of p22phox-(149 &#150;168) caused changes in the chemical shifts for a number of resonance
1|TheKd values for complex formation between p47phox-(151&#150;286) and the two p22phox peptides were subsequently determined by fluorescence titration method. The fluorescence data gave Kd values of 8.67 M for p22phox-(149&#150;162) and 0.64 M for p22phox-(149&#150;168), respectively (Fig. 1, c and d), indicating that residues 163&#150;168 of p22phox enhance the binding affinity of p22phox for p47phox by more than 10-fold.
1|The Kd values for complex formation between p47phox-(151&#150;286) and the two p22phox peptides were subsequently determined by fluorescence titration method. The fluorescence data gave Kd values of 8.67 M for p22phox-(149&#150;162) and 0.64 M for p22phox-(149&#150;168), respectively (Fig. 1, c and d), indicating that residues 163&#150;168 of p22phox enhance the binding affinity of p22phox for p47phox by more than 10-fold.
1|In contrast, the P(r) for the complex showed a peak at 20&#197; and a skirt extending up to 60&#197; (Fig. 2b). From these findings, we concluded that p47phox-(151&#150;286) has a compact globular structure when complexed with p22phox-(149&#150;168), whereas the peptide-free form has an extended structure.
1|As shown in Fig. 8, the A163G/R164G substitution led to decreased binding to p47phox-(151&#150;286), implying a significant role for the p22phox -helical region.  Because the -helix appears to interact directly with Ile164 and Phe209 in the p47phox N- SH3 (Fig. 7a), we next investigated the roles of these residues. For this purpose, we prepared mutants of p47phox-(151&#150;286) carrying substitutions of alanine for Ile164 or Phe209 and tested their ability to bind to p22phox. Compared with the wild-type p47phox-(151&#150;286), the mutant protein with the F209A substitution weakly bound to p22phox (Fig. 8). The I164A substitution resulted in a more impaired interaction with p22phox (Fig. 8), which is consistent with the present finding that Ile164 makes stronger contacts with the p22phox-helix than does Phe209 (Fig. 7a). These mutant p47phox proteins also interacted more weakly with the -helix-defective p22phox (A163G/R164G) than with the wild-type p22phox
0|These results indicate that the alpha-helical conformation of the region C-terminal to the p22phox PRR (amino acids 161&#150;164) participates in the full interaction with p47phox-(151&#150;286).
1|To define the C4BP region involved in M protein binding, deletion mutants of the -chain were tested for binding to theMprotein,
1|In further investigations, the linking sequences between CCPs 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the -chain were engineered by insertions of Ala residues (Fig. 1B). Addition of residues between CCP2 and CCP3, or between CCP3 and CCP4, had no effect on binding, whereas insertions between CCP1 and CCP2 caused a loss of M4 binding.
1|A recombinant protein consisting of residues 1&#150;124 of C4BP -chain (see Fig. 1C, C4BP12), His-tagged at the C terminus, was expressed in E. coli and refolded.

1|After screening human fetal brain cDNA library, several previously known and novel proteins were identified to interact with Parkin, including cyclin E, -tubulin, and RanBP2 (data not shown).
1|As shown in Fig. 1A, the transfected FLAG-tagged Parkin was able to bind to endogenous RanBP2 in the HEK293 cells.
1|When co-immunoprecipitation was performed in reverse with anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-RanBP2 IgGs, the results was the same.
1|After eukaryotic expression plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged Parkin was transfected into the SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1B), the immunoprecipitation was performed with either anti-RanBP2 or anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, Parkin selectively binds to endogenous RanBP2.
1|the co-localization of RanBP2 and GFP-Parkin was observed (Fig. 1C).

1|As expected, immunoprecipitation of either HAP1-A or HAP1-B from PC12 cells pulled down both HAP1-A and HAP1-B. Because PC12 cells express more HAP1-B than HAP1-A, the HAP1-B immunoprecipitation yielded a much greater amount of HAP1-B than HAP1-A.
1|We used a yeast strain expressing Isd11 with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag and performed an IgG affinity purification after lysis of mitochondria under native conditions. We detected a prominent protein band of about 50 kDa and several smaller bands in the eluate that were not found with control mitochondria lacking a TAP tag. A mass spectrometric analysis of these bands led to the identification of numerous peptides derived from Nfs1 and Isd11 (Figure 6A).
1|To determine if the ISD complex contained both Isd11 and Nsf1, radiolabeled Isd11 was imported into Nfs1ProtA mitochondria. The ISD complex was indeed shifted to a higher molecular mass compared to the corresponding wild-type complex (Figure 6D, lanes 3 and 4). The ISD complex was indeed shifted to a higher molecular mass compared to the corresponding wild-type complex (Figure 6D, lanes 3 and 4).
1|To obtain evidence for an interaction of Isd11 and Nfs1 in intact mitochondria, radiolabeled Isd11 was imported into mitochondria containing Nfs1 with a protein A tag (Figure 6B). After crosslinking with m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), Nfs1ProtA was purified by IgG affinity purification. Upon elution with SDS, a radiolabeled band of about 75 kDa was released (Figure 6B, lane 2). The size of 75 kDa corresponds to a crosslinking product between Nfs1ProtA (65 kDa) and Isd11.
1|We purified Nfs1ProtA from mitochondria lysed under non-denaturing conditions by IgG affinity purification and performed a Western blot with antibodies against Isd11 and Isu1. As expected from the stable association in BN-PAGE, Isd11 was efficiently copurified with Nfs1 (Figure 6G).
1|When mitochondrial extracts of WT cells were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Isd11 and Nfs1, Isd11 was co-precipitated with Nfs1 and vice versa (Figure 4C).
1|Significant amounts of two proteins with a molecular weight of about 45 and 14 kDa were coeluted in a specific manner from the beads incubated with the extract containing his-tagged Isd11 (Figure 4A). These proteins were absent in the eluate from the WT strain, in contrast to a few additional other proteins. Mass spectroscopy identified the 45 kDa protein as the mitochondrial desulfurase of the ISC machinery, Nfs1, and the 14 kDa protein as Isd11.
1|(Figure 4B). Together with HA-tagged Isd11, Nfs1 was co-precipitated from the cell extract and was not detectable in the supernatant fraction of the precipitation.

1|To establish whether OR domains could interact directly in solution and to analyze the critical OR length needed for such an interaction, we covalently linked synthetic 1OR (residues 55&#150;67) and 4OR (residues 55&#150;98) peptides via amine linkage to BSA and analyzed copper-dependent OR-OR interactions in vitro by DLS
1|When we incubated Sepharose-immobilized GST&#183;OR fusion proteins with brain extract from ScHa in the presence of sarkosyl-containing buffer, we observed that only GST&#183;16OR captured PrPSc at pH 7.5 in the absence of copper ions (Fig. 3, A and B), demonstrating selective interaction of the expanded OR domain with PrPSc.

1|To demonstrate that the mutants indeed exhibit different binding affinities for transferrin, the cells were incubated with ferri-Tf-FITC and analyzed by flow cytometry.
1|L10P co-eluted with LolA proteins adsorbed to a FLAG tag affinity column (F),
1|we first established an in vitro kinase assay. Rolled (residues 18&#150;376) was produced by coexpression with a constitutively active mutant of mammalian MEK1 (MEK1R4F) in Escherichia coli (Khokhlatchev et al, 1997). As shown in Figure 1C and D, Pnt-P2-SAM could be efficiently phosphorylated by Rolled in vitro. Mutation of Thr151 to Ala in Pnt-P2-SAM completely eliminated phosphorylation (Figure 1C)
1|As shown in Figure 2, treatment with a synthetic TLR3 agonist polyI:C (pIC) resulted in the formation of GRIP1:IRF3 complexes detectable by immunoblotting.
1|One library-encoded clone strongly activated LacZ and Leu2 reporters on galactose (when the GRIP1 bait was expressed) and weakly on glucose, consistent with some bait-independent transcriptional activity. It contained a single open reading frame corresponding to LexA DBD fused to aa 56&#150;369 of the 427-aa human IRF3 protein (Figure 1E).
1|A GST pull-down assay was used to independently confirm the GRIP1:IRF3 interaction. Full-length IRF3 fused to GST was tested with the in vitro-produced 2-RD fragment of GRIP1 (aa 648&#150;1007; Figure 1A) containing the last two NR boxes and the corepression domain. Figure 1B shows that 2-RD bound IRF3. All but the NID interacted with IRF3 (Figure 1C); we mutated the LxxLL motif to LxxAA and found that 3-RDmt bound IRF3 as well as wild type (wt) (Figure 1D).We conclude that 3-RD is the minimal GRIP1 fragment that binds well to IRF3. The GRIP1-interacting region encompasses IRF3 residues 188&#150;369 (IAD).
1|As shown in Figure 3A, GC dexamethasone (Dex)-activated GR bound GRIP1 and adding IRF3 significantly reduced binding (top; lane 3 versus lanes 7 and 8). At the same time, IRF3 bound 3-RD on its own (recapitulating the GRIP1:IRF3 interaction in a different system), and this interaction was greatly diminished by GR (bottom; lane 9 versus lanes 7 and 8).
1|HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with Flag-tagged Smads (S2, S3, S4, S7, CA-S3, or CA-S2), and either Myc-Akt1WT or Myc-Akt1Myr. Co-IP assays showed that all these Smads physically interact with Akt1, with the CA Smads (S3* and S2*) having slightly less affinity than WT Smads to Akt1 (Figure 4D).
1|Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays showed that S3WT physically associates with WT, Myr, and KD forms of Akt1 (Figure 4A). Co-IP experiments revealed that S3 MH2 domain bound to Akt1WT with the highest affinity (Figure 4C).
1|we also showed that endogenous S2 and S3 could co-IP endogenous Akt in NRP-152 cells (Figure 4F).
1|In mock-transfected cells, CLIP-170 and p150glued colocalize at kinetochores (Figure 2C).
1|Indeed, GFP-CLIP-170-DeltaN colocalized with dynein at kinetochores and at the spindle (Figure 4A).
1|When interphase cells were examined that express full-length GFP-CLIP-170 or GFP-CLIP-170-DeltaC, clear comet-like staining was observed at the ends of microtubules (Figure 3C). In contrast, neither GFP-CLIP-170-DeltaN nor GFP-CLIP-170-DeltaN-DeltaC localized to microtubule plus ends in fixed interphase cells (Figure 3C), confirming that the N-terminal domain is essential for microtubule plus end binding in interphase.
1|As MEKK3 and TRAF6 physically interact with each other, we reasoned that the TRAF6-associated MEKK3 may be activated and thus Ser 526 phosphorylated. Indeed, using the anti-p-MEKK2/3 antibody, we found that Ser 526 was phosphorylated in the LPS-induced, TRAF6-associated MEKK3 (Figure 5E).
1|At the major contact, mutation of Glu59Axl and Thr77Axl dramatically reduced Gas6 binding both in a solid-phase assay and when measured by surface plasmon resonance (Table I). Likewise, mutation of Arg310Gas6 and Lys312Gas6 all but abolished Axl binding in both assays. Thus, the major contact in the Gas6-LG/Axl-IG complex indeed corresponds to the high-affinity interaction site.
1|MBP-Adi3 mutant proteins co-immunoprecipitated in vitro with Pdk1-FLAG in equal amounts (Figure 2D).
1|We found that it is an active protein kinase in autophosphorylation assays by using kinase-active MBP-Pdk1 and kinase-inactive MBP-Pdk1K77Q (subdomain II conserved Lys) proteins (Figure 2A).
1|e examined the possible autophosphorylation activity of MBP-Adi3. MBP-Adi3 showed autophosphorylation activity, whereas MBP-Adi3K337Q, which has a substitution at the ATP-binding site, did not (Figure 1A).  Mutation of F697, E698, and F700 to Ala, singly or in combination, completely eliminated Adi3 autophosphorylation (Figure 3D).
1|When MBP-Adi3 was incubated with MBP-PtoD164N, phosphorylation of PtoD164N was not seen regardless of the presence of AvrPto (Figure 1C, lanes 7 and 8). These data demonstrate that Adi3 is a substrate for Pto.
1|Mutation of S539 to Asp, simulating a phosphorylation event, greatly increases the autophosphorylation activity of Adi3 (Figure 1A), suggesting that phosphorylation of S539 by Pdk1 is required for activation of Adi3. MBP-Pdk1 phosphorylated MBP-Adi3 but it phosphorylated MBP-Adi3S539A at a much reduced level (Figure 2C). MBP-Pdk1 phosphorylation of MBP-Adi3K337Q followed by phosphoamino acid analysis indicates that only Ser residues are phosphorylated on Adi3 by Pdk1 (Figure 2E).  Combining all three substitutions gave the greatest loss of Pdk1 phosphorylation of Adi3 (Figure 3B). Taken together, these data indicate that Pdk1 phosphorylates Adi3 at S539 (Figure 2C, E, and F)
1|In the Y2H assay, Pdk1 did not interact with Pto or AvrPto, but did interact with Adi3 irrespective of the kinase activity of Adi3 or Pdk1 (Figure 2B).
1|We performed GST pull-down assays by using an Hkb&#150;GST fusion expressed in bacteria and found that in vitro-translated Gcm binds GST&#150;Hkb, but not GST alone (negative control) (Figure 4C). Binding specificity was further confirmed by using in vitro-translated Luciferase instead of Gcm (Figure 4C). Deletion analyses indicate that binding is mediated by Gcm Nt and HKB C-terminal (Ct-Hkb) regions (Figures 4C and E).
1|Gcm&#150;Hkb interactions were also confirmed in two-hybrid assay (Supplementary Figure 1).
1|We analysed its site specificity using histone substrates radiolabelled at all known methylated sites in histones H3 (K4, K9, K27, K36, K79) and H4 (K20, R3). Of the seven substrates, only H3-K36 methylated by Set2 was a substrate for JHDM1A
0|Thus, we conclude that JHDM1A is an H3-K36-specific demethylase.
1|We found that both AAxxAACxxC and ACxxCAAxxA   have large defects in promoting RNase A folding when compared with wild-type PDI under conditions in which the number of active sites are matched (Fig. 2B).
1|We matched the rate of RNase A oxidation by ERp57 and Ero1p to the rate with PDI and Ero1p by either altering ERp57 levels (data not shown) or using more Ero1p (Fig. 6D).
1|We found that at 3 M, the N-terminal active site (ACxxCAAxxA) has over a 4-fold defect in the initial rate of oxidation when compared with wild-type PDI (Fig. 3A). In contrast, as we saw previously AAxxAACxxC has a rate of oxidation that is close to that of wild-type PDI, and when the Ero1p concentration is increased modestly (1.3-fold), the initial rates of oxidation can be matched (Fig. 3A)
1|We used the ThioGlo1 fluorescence assay to establish conditions in which the initial rate of oxidation of PDI is linearly dependent on its concentration and the relative rate of oxidation of the PDI active sites can be compared (Fig. 4A).
1|the rate of oxidation of the A domain is  half that of AAxxAACxxC indicating that the enhanced rate of oxidation of theA domain in the full-length protein is contingent on the presence of the A domain (Fig. 4C). Additionally, the rates of oxidation of BBA, BA and A are the same, demonstrating that the loss of either the B or B domain does not affect the interaction with Ero1p (Fig. 4C). Also, there is no difference in the rate of oxidation of the N- and C-terminalactive sites in the PDI truncation mutants (A versus A)
1|We found, using the ThioGlo1 assay, that ERp57 and the individual ERp57 thioredoxin domains, A and A, are all oxidized by Ero1p in vitro (Fig. 6B).
0|Interaction of CgA and CgB with mutant SOD in cultured cell lines.
0|Selective interactions of chromogranins with mutant SOD1 species but not with wild-type SOD1.
1|We also detected partial colocalisation of mutant SOD1 with CgA and CgB in irregular and large vesicular struuctures of spinal neurons from G37R transgenic mice.
1|Western analysis of the immunoprecipitates demonstrated that both G37R and G93A SOD1 co-precipitated with TNG38
1|Western blotting revealed that mutant SOD1 had a distribution pattern similar to chromogranins, the trans golgi marker adaptin and the SNARE protein syntaxin-1.
1|Pull down showing CgA and CgB interacted with mutant SOD1
1|Double immunohistochemistry using secondary antibodies conjugated with different gold particles (5nm and 10nm)provided frequent detection of cluster complexes comprising SOD1 and chromogranins.
1|MG-132 treatments increased the levels of ubiquitinated HDAC1 (Fig 2C).
1|To determine whether full-length Trf5p is present in a TRAMP-like complex, we analysed proteins that co-precipitated with the corrected Trf5&#150;TAP construct (Fig 4E). Both Mtr4p and Air1p were identified by mass spectrometry as bands that showed approximate stoichiometry with Trf5&#150;TAP.
1|Similar to the behaviour of the proteins in the in vitro binding assay, we found that pRb763&#150;928 bound to E2F-1 and that altering KK873/874 to RR873/874 had a marginal effect on binding efficiency (Fig 3C). In contrast, pRb QQ873/874 was significantly reduced in its interaction with E2F-1 (Fig 3C). The interaction of pRb763&#150;928 with E2F-1 and the influence of QQ873/874 observed in vitro is therefore recapitulated in cells.
1|(Fig 3B). As a control for the integrity of the pRb mutant derivatives, we measured the binding of pRb to Mdm2, because Mdm2 interacts with the C-terminal region of pRb (Xiao et al, 1995).
1|In extracts prepared from 293 cells, the binding of E2F-1 to RR873/874 was marginally reduced relative to the interaction with the wild-type pRb domain; in contrast, the binding to QQ873/874 was significantly less (Fig 3B).
0|Lsh interacts with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b.
1|When cells expressing YFP-RAD51C were immunoprecipitated for endogenous RAD51, a complex between RAD51 and YFP-RAD51C was observed (Figure 1E).
1|Interestingly, immunoprecipitations of RAD51 and RAD51C coexpressed in insect cells show that this interaction is direct (Figure 1B).
1|Conversely, a complex between endogenous RAD51C and CFP-RAD51 was observed (Figure 1F).
1|we found HDAC1 and HDAC2 associated with the TAL-1&#150;biotin tag protein
0|Two members of the ETO (821) family were also identified, ETO2 and MTGR1.
0|In addition to all known TAL-1 partners, novel protein interactions were identified (Figure 1A).
1|In GST pull-down assays, ETO2 interacts with E2A and HEB
1|Three members of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSDP) were pulled down by the TAL-1 bait, SSDP1, 2 and 3
1|As shown in Figure 1B, Ldb1, ETO2, E2A and TAL-1 co-immunoprecipitate, suggesting that they could be part of the same nuclear complex.
1|In this screening, we observed a time-dependent increase in Dok-1/2 association with the adaptor protein Shc, 50-inositol phosphatase SHIP, and GTPase-activating protein RasGAP, suggesting the formation of an intermolecular complex
1|immunoaffinity-purified WT but not kinase-dead TRPM7 efficiently phosphorylated recombinant myosin IIA

1|Endogenous TRPM7 associates with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. PC12 lysates were incubated with preimmune serum or anti-TRPM7 serum and protein complexes were isolated using protein G-Sepharose. The presence of myosin IIA was detected by Western blotting. Top, detection of associated myosin IIA heavy chain in immunoprecipitates;
0|Ppt1 specifically dephosphorylates Hsp90
1|the ITC data show that two Ppt1 molecules bind to a yHsp90 dimer.
1|fragments of Ppt1 were generated (Figure 1B) and used in a modified ELISA to determine the association of Ppt1 and Ppt1 fragments with yHsp90
1|Fig. 3A suggested that PAK1 was co-immunoprecipitated with HA&#150;p110C and the co-expressed PAK1m evidently blocked this interaction
1|The association between LATS2 and Ajuba required two regions within the Nterminal half of LATS2 (amino acids 376&#150;392 and 629&#150;644) and the second LIM domain of Ajuba (Fig. 1D&#150;F).
1|To identify cellular proteins that interact with LATS2, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using a LATS2 sequence (amino acids 376&#150;624) as a bait (Fig. 1A). Screening of 1 &#183; 107 transformants yielded 57 positive clones, including clones that encoded a protein fragment derived from Ajuba (Fig. 1B).
1|Endogenous LATS2 was co-immunoprecipitated with Ajuba predominantly from mitotic lysates, suggesting that interaction between LATS2 and Ajuba is prominent during mitosis (Fig. 1C).

1|Endogenous ZNF216 was also detected in the GST-Ubl/26S proteasome complex (upper panels, Figure 2B).
0|ZNF216 directly binds to polyubiquitin
1|To identify the region of ZNF216 required for association with the 26S proteasome, lysates of cells expressing either FLAGtagged ZNF216 or its mutants were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Co-precipitation of proteasomal components was monitored by immunoblotting using an antibody against Rpn7p (S10a),

1|TRBP was coimmunoprecipitated in all fractions where PACT was present, indicating that PACT interacts with TRBP
0|we found that PACT and TRBP interacted efficiently with Dicer
1|The Dicer mutants, DeltaHelicC, DeltaDUF, and DeltaPAZ, were unable to interact with either PACT or TRBP. Thus, the highly conserved helicase motif whose biochemical role in Dicer remains unknown may be critical for the interaction with PACT and TRBP (Figure 2C and D).
1|Coimmunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting revealed that PACT is indeed associated with hAgo2
0|we found that PACT and TRBP interacted efficiently with Dicer
1|We co-transfected 293 cells with expression plasmids for HA-tagged p53RFP and FLAG-tagged UbcH7, and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The results indicated that p53RFP interacted with UbcH7 (Fig. 2A). In the same experiments, p53RFP also interacted with UbcH8 but not UbcH5 (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that p53RFP specifically interacts with UbcH7 and UbcH8.

0|AtWNK8 phosphorylates AtVHA-C
1|In order to evaluate the effect of these peptides on the PSD-95, SynGAP and NR2B subunit co-association in our system, we immunoprecipitated PSD-95 from peptide loaded cells and Western blot probed to detect for each protein (Fig. 5). We found (in agreement with others using slightly longer C-terminal peptides in brain slice experiments [35]) that peptides P2 and P3 inhibited the PSD-95 co-association with NR2B subunits
1|Due to their close proximity in the localizations in MDCK cell monolayers, immunoprecipitation was performed to investigate whether ZO-1 is part of the protein complexes with claudin-19, and indeed, a putative associated adaptor in the claudin-19-containing protein complexes (Fig. 3G).
1|A similar phosphorylation of GST-Hcore was observed with PKAI&amp;#945; (Fig. 2B)
1|Using Hcore164B and three Hcore164B variants (Hcore164B-AS, Hcore164B-SA and Hcore164B-AA), the phosphorylation sites for two PKAs (PKAI&amp;#945; and PKAII&amp;#945;) on Hcore164B were determined in vitro. No phosphorylation was detected when Hcore164B-AA was used as a phosphate acceptor for PKAII&amp;#945; (lane 6, Fig. 3). The phosphorylation level of Hcore164B-AS (lane 4) by PKAII&amp;#945; was about half of the phosphorylation of Hcore164B (lane 2, Fig. 3). In contrast, Hcore164B-SA (lane 5) functioned as a poor substrate for PKAII&amp;#945;, as compared with Hcore164B-AS (lane 4, Fig. 3).
1|Two GST-Hcore fusion polypeptides [Hcore157B (lane 2) and Hcore164B (lane 3, Fig. 2C)], containing Ser-170 and Ser-178, were highly phosphorylated by PKAII&amp;#945; in the presence of 1 &amp;#956;M cAMP in vitro
1|As demonstrated in our previous report [9], it was confirmed that (i) free RII&amp;#945; was phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro (lane 3, Fig. 4A)
1|Fig. 2A shows that (i) PKAII&amp;#945; phosphorylates GST-Hcore in vitro
0|Identification of AtDi19 as an AtCPK11-interacting protein
1|We tested the interaction of the Zn finger domains and the NLS/NES sequences with AtCPK11 and determined that the NLS/NES region was necessary and sufficient for interaction with the kinase, although this interaction was slightly weaker than if both Zn finger domains and the NLS/ NES region were present (Fig. 5B).
1|This hypothesis was further confirmed by in vitro kinase assays using the peptide S100GTNSTLSLLR110 fused to GST as a substrate. We demonstrated that this wild type peptide was phosphorylated by AtCPK11 in vitro (Km = 25 lM) (Fig. 7A).

1|We confirmed this result by an alternative assay using V5-tagged FLRT3 to co-immunoprecipitate various Renilla luciferase (RL)-tagged proteins, which can be detected quantitatively in bioluminescence assays. RL&#150;FLRT1, RL&#150;FLRT2 and RL&#150;FLRT3 were significantly enriched compared with unrelated transmembrane proteins (RL&#150;BMPRI, RL&#150;Frizzled8; Fig 1B).
1|As reported previously for FLRT3 (Bo&#168; ttcher et al, 2004), FLRT2 interacts with FGFR1DC but not with the full-length FGFR1, probably owing to steric reasons (Fig 1C).
1|We confirmed this result by an alternative assay using V5-tagged FLRT3 to co-immunoprecipitate various Renilla luciferase (RL)-tagged proteins, which can be detected quantitatively in bioluminescence assays. RL&#150;FLRT1, RL&#150;FLRT2 and RL&#150;FLRT3 were significantly enriched compared with unrelated transmembrane proteins (RL&#150;BMPRI, RL&#150;Frizzled8; Fig 1B).
1|In co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), V5 epitope-tagged FLRT3 precipitates Flag epitope-tagged FLRT3 as well as FGFR1 (full-length and cytoplasmic domaindeleted (DC) protein), but not BMP type I receptor (BMPRI; Fig 1A)
1|Bcr was not able to displace Tcf4 from &amp;#946;-catenin, whereas Bcr dissociated the Tcf1/&amp;#946;-catenin complex (Fig. 2B, C).
1|First we expressed the predominant in vivo isoform of Tcf1, P45Tcf1B, with Bcr in HEK293 cells which did not result in a Tcf1B/&amp;#946;-catenin complex (Fig. 2A, lane 1)
1|We observed complex formation of endogenous Bcr and Tcf1 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1A)
1|Using monoclonal anti-MT antibody, p53 protein was co-precipitated with MT from the protein lysates of both MN1 cells and MDD2 cells (Fig. 1B)
1|To determine the nature of the p53-MT interaction, we employed a GST-pull-down assay to analyze the in vitro GSH-wt-p53 interaction with purified rabbit liver Cd, Zn-MT1 and apo-MT1 as described in Fig. 2B. Unbound proteins were removed by washing and the bound proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. We found that only apo-MT was able to bind to immobilized GST-wt-p53
1|By incubating increasing concentrations of GTP-tubulin with a constant level of the H2 fragment of CLIP-170 covalently bound to Sepharose beads, we measured an approximate Kd of 0.6 &#177; 0.1 lM for the binding of CLIP-170 to unpolymerized tubulin, assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry of tubulin dimer to CLIP-170 (Fig. 2B).
1|Using microtubule co-sedimentation assays, we measured the affinity of the H2 fragment of CLIP-170 for microtubules, and estimated a Kd = 1.3 &#177; 0.3 lM (Fig. 2A) based upon a 1:1 stoichiometry of tubulin dimer to CLIP-170 H2 polypeptide.

1|The bo2R6 peptide found to interact with bovine IgG2 was then truncated from both ends to identify the shortest effective peptide for IgG2 binding
1|The peptide 6N2-C5 was used to evaluate the inhibition effect on bovine IgG2 binding to boFc&amp;#947;2R. In the competitive ELISA, the 6N2-C5 peptide inhibited the binding of bovine IgG2 to the soluble boFc&amp;#947;2R coated on the plate, whereas the control peptide bo2R1 had little effect on the IgG2 binding. The IC50 value of 6N2-C5 peptide was calculated to be 27.35 &amp;#956;M after unspecific inhibition of the control peptide was subtracted
1|Fig. 5 showed that the peptide 6N2-C5 inhibited the binding of bovine IgG2-sensitized RBCs on the transfected COS-7 cells with IC50 value of 139.08 &amp;#956;M, which was about 480-fold less than that of the intact receptor (IC50 = 0.29 &amp;#956;M).

1|This observation was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of p205 and p53 in U20s cells. Specifically, p53 was detected in immunoprecipitates of cell lysates obtained from U20s cells transfected with pCB6-FLAG-p205 using antibodies that recognize FLAG-tagged p205 by Western blot analysis

1|In pull down assays, we found that GST-p205, but not GST alone, can bind specifically to p53
1|Our results indicated that Rb is pulled down by GST-p205, but not GST alone, suggesting that p205 can bind to Rb
1|The GST pull downs were verified by immunoprecipitating p205 with a FLAG tag, then probing for Rb via Western blot analysis (Fig. 6B)
1|eIF4E also colocalizes with 4E-T in P-bodies, where mRNA is degraded or stored (Andrei et al, 2005). Hypoxia caused a redistribution of both eIF4E and 4E-T from predominantly cytoplasmic staining under aerobic conditions to substantial nuclear staining during hypoxia (Figure 5A&#150;C).
1|the active radixin T564D mutant displayed specific interaction, whereas the nonactivatable (K(253,254,262,263)N) mutant did not bind to alpha5 subunit loops (Figure 2E). Remarkably, under these conditions, specific interaction with the GABAAR alpha5 subunit intracellular loop was observed (Figure 2F and data not shown)
1|As detected with a radixin-specific antibody, endogenous radixin specifically co-precipitated with endogenous GABAAR alpha5 subunit protein (Figure 2A).
1|Immunostaining of mature hippocampal cultures revealed a significant number of colocalized puncta in neuronal dendrites (Figure 3), indicating that endogenous radixin is localized to positions that harbour endogenous GABAAR alpha5 subunit clusters (Figure 3, A3).
1|three clones were isolated that coded for amino acids 89&#150;185 of radixin, a member of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) protein family, known to interact with transmembrane proteins (Tsukita et al, 1994) (Figure 1A&#150;C).
1|Immunostaining of mature hippocampal cultures revealed a significant number of colocalized puncta in neuronal dendrites (Figure 3).
1|To investigate whether active radixin could bind to the GABAAR alpha5 intracellular TMIII&#150;TMIV loop, we performed GST-pulldown assays using rat brain extracts (Figure 2C), and probed them with radixin-specific or anti-ERM C-terminal phospho-threonine-specific antibodies. Radixin displayed specific binding to immobilized GST-GABAAR alpha5 loop fusion protein but not to GST alone.

1|we generated two 10-residue fragments of p53 containing residues 358-EPGGSRAHSS-367 and 356-GKEPGGSRAH-365 and quantified binding by following the change in intrinsic fluorescence of the USP7 NTD (Table 1). The 358&#150;367 fragment bound the USP7 NTD with a similar affinity to that of the 355&#150;393 fragment (Kd = 11 muM). Peptide 356&#150;365 also bound USP7, although with a slightly reduced affinity

The 358&#150;367 fragment bound the USP7 NTD with a similar affinity to that of the 355&#150;393 fragment (Kd = 11 muM).
1|More quantitative analyses were then conducted for Asp164 and Asn169 mutants by following the change in fluorescence of the USP7 NTD upon titration with EBNA1, p53 and MDM2 peptides (Table 1). This analysis could not include the Trp165 mutant, as this residue is responsible for the fluorescence signal that is altered by peptide binding. These assays confirmed that there was little effect of the Asn169 mutation on binding to any of the peptides, although EBNA1 binding was reduced approximately two-fold. The Asp164 mutation decreased binding two- to three-fold for all target peptides.
1|Sequence-specific contacts of 359-PGGS-362 with USP7 are mediated by p53 Pro359&apos; and Ser362&apos;. We tested the importance of these contacts by mutating these residues to alanines. The individual point mutations reduced binding up to two-fold, and the binding affinity of the double mutant was reduced three-fold
1|Interactions of these peptides with the USP7 NTD were determined by monitoring the change in intrinsic fluorescence of USP7 at peptide concentrations up to 100 muM. Whereas no binding was detected with peptides 1 (85-LFGVPSFSVK-94), 2 (109-VVVNQQESSDS-118) and 3 (126-RCHLEGGSDQ-135), titratable binding was seen with peptides 4 (141-ELQEEKPSSS-150), 5 (152-LVSRPSTSSR-161) and 6 (143-QEEKPSSSHL-152)
1|More quantitative analyses were then conducted for Asp164 and Asn169 mutants by following the change in fluorescence of the USP7 NTD upon titration with EBNA1, p53 and MDM2 peptides (Table 1). This analysis could not include the Trp165 mutant, as this residue is responsible for the fluorescence signal that is altered by peptide binding. These assays confirmed that there was little effect of the Asn169 mutation on binding to any of the peptides, although EBNA1 binding was reduced approximately two-fold.
1|To further investigate the nature of the interaction of the mutant p53 peptide (acetyl&#150;358-EAGGARAHSS-367&#150;amide) with USP7, this peptide was cocrystallized with the USP7 NTD. The structure of the complex was determined using molecular replacement and the model refined to 1.60-&#197; resolution
1|We examined whether this interaction is direct by pull-down assays using equimolar amounts of purified full-length USP7 and MDM2 fragments fused to GST. GST fusions containing MDM2 residues 1&#150;280 or 1&#150;160 each caused the retention of USP7 on glutathione resin, which was not seen with GST alone (Fig. 3a). This indicated that the MDM2-USP7 interaction is direct and is mediated by sequences between residues 1 and 160. To determine whether this interaction occurs through the USP7 NTD, we repeated the pull-down assay with GST-MDM21&#150;160 and the USP7 NTD (Fig. 3b). The USP7 NTD was retained on the glutathione resin by MDM21&#150;160, to a similar degree as by EBNA1.
1|The USP7-binding regions of EBNA1, p53 and MDM2 were initially tested for binding to USP7 NTD mutants using GST pull-down assays (Fig. 5a&#150;c, respectively). For all three peptides, the Trp165 mutation abrogated binding, the Asp164 mutation decreased binding and the Asn169 mutation had no obvious effect.
1|GST pull-down assays performed as in a except that the USP7 NTD was used in place of full-length USP7. GST-EBNA1 is shown as a positive control.
1|The crystal structures of the USP7 NTD bound to EBNA1, p53 and MDM2 peptides have shown that all these peptides contact USP7 residues Asp164 and Trp165 and that EBNA1 also specifically contacts Asn169 (ref. 11). We investigated the relative importance of these residues in peptide binding by generating point mutations in the USP7 NTD where each of these residues was individually mutated to alanine, as well as a fourth mutant where both Asp164 and Trp165 were mutated. Each mutant was also analyzed by 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectroscopy in order to confirm that the mutations did not affect the folding of the protein (data not shown). The USP7-binding regions of EBNA1, p53 and MDM2 were initially tested for binding to USP7 NTD mutants using GST pull-down assays (Fig. 5a&#150;c, respectively). For all three peptides, the Trp165 mutation abrogated binding, the Asp164 mutation decreased binding and the Asn169 mutation had no obvious effect.
1|We also examined the interaction of MDM21&#150;160 with the USP7 NTD by gel-filtration analysis (Fig. 3c). In keeping with the pull-down results, a complex was formed between the two proteins that comigrated on the gel-filtration column. The interaction was disrupted by addition of the USP7-binding fragment of EBNA1 (395&#150;450) to the binding reaction.
1|The interaction was disrupted by addition of the USP7-binding fragment of EBNA1 (395&#150;450) to the binding reaction. This fragment formed a complex with the USP7 NTD
1|Crystals of the USP7 NTD bound to peptide 4 (acetyl&#150;141-ELQEEKPSSS-150&#150;amide) were obtained, the structure of the complex was determined using molecular replacement and the model was refined to 2.1-&#197; resolution
1|we performed NMR titration experiments with WT p53 and EBNA1 peptides on uniformly 15N-labeled USP7 NTD with mutated Trp165. In both experiments, negligible changes were observed compared to those seen for WT USP7 NTD
1|Full-sized WT-, A6-, Cy- and A6Cy-Cdt1-3NLSmyc were transfected into 293T cells and immunoprecipitated. PCNA was detected in WT-Cdt1 precipitate, and at higher amount in Cy-Cdt1 precipitates, but not in vector-transfected cell extract (Figure 7B).
1|The specific binding of PCNA to Cdt1 was confirmed in an in vitro pull-down assay showing that PCNA in the HeLa nuclear extract binds to GST-Cdt1, but not to GST alone (Figure 7A).
1|Figure 7A: Geminin serves as a positive control in this assay.
1|The complexes isolated by size exclusion chromatography were analysed using nondissociative mass spectrometry. Both complexes gave rise to two major ion series (Figure 2B and G); a complex between an activin dimer and one chain of the follistatin construct (1:1 complex; charge states labelled with underlined text), and a higher intensity 1:2 complex. Each of these complexes was independently identified using tandem mass spectrometry
1|Titration of the follistatin fragments into activin A indicated these two fragments had near-identical affinities with Kd of 430 nM for Fs12 and 420 nM for Fs123 (Figure 2E and J, respectively).
1|Most importantly, we established that 14-3-3alt epsilon and DP-3 interact under physiological conditions by immunoprecipitating 14-3-3alt epsilon from ML-1 cells, where human DP-2 (the human equivalent of murine DP-3) was specifically detected in the immunocomplex (Figure 3G). Thus, DP-3 and 14-3-3alt epsilon interact under physiological conditions.
1|The interaction was tested in mammalian U2OS cells using the two-hybrid assay with VP16-tagged 14-3-3alt epsilon and Gal4-DNA-binding domain-tagged DP-3delta or DP-1 where significant stimulation of activity was apparent when VP16-14-3-3alt epsilon was co-expressed with Gal4-DP-3delta but not with Gal4-DP-1 (Figure 2D).
1|We next studied the interaction between DP-3delta and 14-3-3alt epsilon in cells. By immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting, DP-3delta and 14-3-3alt epsilon bound specifically to each other, and the interaction was not altered by the presence of the E2F subunit (Figure 3C). A similar level of specificity was apparent when antibodies against either DP-3delta or 14-3-3alt epsilon were used in the primary immunoprecipitation step (Figure 3C&#150;E).
1|DP-3delta and 14-3-3alt epsilon bound specifically to each other, and the interaction was not altered by the presence of the E2F subunit (Figure 3C).
1|Figure 6:Intracellular location of 14-3-3alt epsilon and DP-3delta.
1|Thus, DP-3 5S bound to an E2F partner (Figure 3B),
1|he DP-3 5S mutant, where five serine residues in DP-3delta had been changed to alanine (Figure 2B), failed to interact with 14-3-3alt epsilon, in contrast to the other mutant derivatives 2S, 3S and 4S, which retained binding activity (Figure 3B, and data not shown).
1|the specificity of the interaction was assessed in yeast where the interaction between 14-3-3alt epsilon and DP-3 was found to be dependent upon the presence of both the E and B region, since the natural DP-3beta isoform (which lacks the E region) and the DP-3DeltaB mutant derivative (lacking the stretch of basic residues) failed to interact (Figure 2B and C). It is consistent with this idea that DP-1, which lacks sequence that exhibits similarity to the E region (Ormondroyd et al, 1995), also failed to interact with 14-3-3alt epsilon (Figure 2C).
1|The DP-3 5S mutant, where five serine residues in DP-3delta had been changed to alanine (Figure 2B), failed to interact with 14-3-3alt epsilon, in contrast to the other mutant derivatives 2S, 3S and 4S, which retained binding activity (Figure 3B, and data not shown). Similarly, in cells there was very reduced binding to 14-3-3alt epsilon (Figure 3D and E), suggesting that DP-3 5S is a mutant derivative devoid of 14-3-3alt epsilon binding activity.
1|OB-Ra and OB-Rb were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and analyzed by immunoblotting with two anti-ubiquitin MAbs. Both receptor isoforms displayed increased apparent molecular weight, when analyzed with the MAb P4D1 (Figure 5A), which recognizes mono-ubiquitin, as well as poly-ubiquitin chains.
1|Ubiquitin-conjugates were purified on nickel beads, and OB-R constructs were detected by immunoblotting. For OB-Ra, 3KR, and 2KRK constructs, two immunoreactive bands were detected when His6-tagged ubiquitin was co-expressed, whereas only the lower band was detected with the double mutant 2K2R (Figure 5B).
1|As can been seen in Fig 3E, the two GINS family members and RecJdbh co-purified in eight steps, supporting the notion that they exist as a stable complex in cells.
1|As can be seen in Fig 3A, three proteins eluted specifically from the anti-Gins23 antisera column. These were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry as Gins23 and the products of the SSO0295 and SSO1049 open reading frames.
1|As described above, Gins23 interacted with MCM and also with both large and small subunits of the archaeal primase (Fig 4A)
1|As can be seen in the upper panels of Fig 4C,D, GINS was retained on columns containing MCM or primase, but not by the matrix alone, or by matrix containing PCNA2
1|To test whether the MCM&#150;Gins23 interaction detected in the yeast two-hybrid assay was representative of a physiologically relevant interaction in S. solfataricus cells, we carried out immunoprecipitation assays. The results indicate that Gins23 and MCM can be co-immunoprecipitated. We tested the ability of MCM and Gins23 to co-precipitate from extracts prepared from cells in early and mid-logarithmic growth and also from stationary phase.
1|In the course of a two-hybrid screen to identify potential binding partners of the MCM protein of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, we identified open reading frame SSO0772 as a candidate interaction partner.Yeast cells were transformed with these constructs together with MCM-DBD- and MCM-AD-expressing plasmids. As can be seen in Fig 1A, the SSO0772 protein interacts with MCM in both DBD and AD fusion contexts. Next, we tested the ability of SSO0772 to interact with amino- and carboxy-terminally truncated MCM. The results shown in Fig 1B indicate that SSO0772 interacts with the N-terminal 266 residues of MCM.
1|A two-hybrid matrix indicated that Gins15 could interact with itself, with Gins23 and with RecJdbh.
1|Analytical gel filtration gave an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa. As a dimer of Gins23 and Gins15 would have a mass of 37 kDa, it seems that the core archaeal GINS complex is tetrameric, containing a dimer of dimers.
1|As shown in Fig 4A, Myc-tagged Cnb1p and haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Yap1p were co-precipitated in a reciprocal manner.

1|SOX10 sumoylation was confirmed by the opposite experiment, where we immunoprecipitated SOX10 and revealed SUMO expression. We observed the same band at a higher molecular weight, corresponding to the sumoylated form of the SOX10 protein
1|We then performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HeLa cells transfected with expression vectors allowing for production of HA-tagged SOX10 and V5-tagged UBC9 proteins. Upon precipitation of the SOX10 protein with anti-HA antibody, Western blot detection revealed expression of UBC9-V5 (25 kDa) in the sample (Fig. 1, lane 6), indicating that UBC9 was co-immunoprecipitated with SOX10
1|To determine the relative influence of these sumoylation sites on SOX10&#150;UBC9 interaction, we mutated each site individually or simultaneously in the SOX10 protein and performed a liquid &amp;#946;-galactosidase activity measurement in yeast.
1|When SOX10-HA, UBC9-V5 and/or Myc-SUMO1 were co-transfected in HeLa cells, detection of UBC9 expression revealed two bands, a 25 kDa band corresponding to the tagged protein, and a band of higher molecular weight that may correspond to conjugation of an endogenous SUMO peptide to the UBC9 protein
1|A C-terminal fragment of the rat ortholog of a human protein originally named Bex1 (Brown and Kay, 1999) was isolated in a T7 phage display screen for interacting partners of the intracellular domain of p75NTR (Figure 1A).
1|p75NTR could be specifically co-immunoprecipitated with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Bex1 in transfected HEK293 T (293) cells (Figure 1B).
1|Using anti-Bex1 antibodies, endogenous Bex1 could be specifically co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous p75NTR in parental PC12 cells (Figure 1E), indicating that the two proteins are able to interact when expressed at physiological levels.
1|Flag-tagged Bex1 (Flag-Bex1) could also be co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous p75NTR in two PC12 cell clones&#151;termed E2 and C4&#151;generated by stable transfection (Figure 1C and D).
1|We next analyzed the recruitment of FADD to activated CD95, one of the most proximal biochemical events in DISC formation. While FADD readily co-immunoprecipitated with CD95L-bound CD95 in control cells, no association of FADD with activated CD95 was detected in FynC-GFP-INP54p+ BJAB cells (Figure 1B, top row). Similarly, while caspase-8 and -10 were readily co-immunoprecipitated with CD95/CD95L complexes in control cells, neither was detected with activated CD95 in FynC-INP54p+ BJAB cells (second and third rows).
1|The in vitro translated ICDs of wt CD95 (lane 1), internalization mutant CD95(Y291F) (lane 2), or the corresponding hCD95 mutation(V254N) in lprcg mice (lane 3) fused to a FLAG epitope was incubated with a biotinylated FADD DD. Flag-CD95-bound FADD was immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag mAb-coupled beads and analyzed by blotting for FADD and Flag. Flag-epitope-tagged GFP was used as a control protein (lane 4).
1|At 15 min following CD95L engagement, when FADD association with CD95 was maximal in these cells (see Figure 1B), significant colocalization of CD95 and FADD was detected in a TfR+ early endosomal compartment (Figure 5A, panels 11&#150;15).
1|At 15 min following CD95L engagement, when FADD association with CD95 was maximal in these cells (see Figure 1B), significant colocalization of CD95 and FADD was detected in a TfR+ early endosomal compartment (Figure 5A, panels 11&#150;15). Similarly, colocalization of CD95 and activated caspase-8 was readily detected within an EEA-1+ compartment within 15 min following CD95L engagement (Figure 5B, panels 4&#150;6).
1|Chs6p-9myc was crosslinked to Chs3p (Figure 9A).
1|When polyclonal AU5 antibodies were used for precipitation, all the three other ChAPs were detected (Figure 4). Co-precipitation was specific, because no ChAPs were detected from control strains lacking the AU5 tag.
1|To test if the other ChAPs would also bind to Chs5p, we performed precipitations with Chs5p antiserum on the same lysates that were used to detect the Arf1p interaction (Figure 7). All ChAPs co-immunoprecipitated with Chs5p (Figure 7B, lane 5).
1|A similar result was obtained for Bud7p-9myc that was precipitated with monoclonal myc antibodies. Again, Bch2p, Chs6p and Bch1p were detected when Bud7p-9myc was precipitated and were absent when control lysates lacking the myc epitope were used.
1|We found that Chs5p bound specifically to the activated form of Arf1p (Figure 2B)
1|To test whether the other ChAPs can also interact with Arf1p, we performed co-immunoprecipitations with alpha-Arf1p antibodies on lysates from strains where the ChAPs were appended chromosomally with a 9myc-tag. The proteins were expressed from their endogenous promotor and were fully functional. A signal for Bch1p-9myc, Bud7p-9myc, Chs6p-9myc and Bch2p-9myc was obtained in the precipitate (Figures 2C and 7A), indicating that all ChAPs can associate with Arf1p.
1|We could also detect an interaction of Chs3p with Bch1p-9myc and Bch2p-9myc (Figure 9B), indicating that they might also be involved in export of Chs3p from the TGN.
1|As expected from their biological functions, the coatomer complex and the ARF-GAP Glo3p bound preferentially to Arf1p-GTP, whereas the ARF-GEF Gea2p bound only to Arf1p-GDP (Figure 2A).
1|The Figure 3 shows that thymocytes from Notch3-IC transgenic thymocytes display higher levels of NIK (Figure 3D) as well as increased IKKalpha/NIK complex (Figure 3E), when compared to wild-type and double-mutant thymocytes.
1|Thymocyte extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKalpha, followed by immunoblotting with IKKbeta and IKKalpha. Figure 3C shows a decrease of IKKalpha/IKKbeta complex formation in Notch3-IC/pTalpha-/- thymocytes with respect to Notch3-IC cells, while showing a slight increase of IKKalpha revealed by immunoblotting with IKKalpha itself, in the same extracts.
1|In a quantitative analysis of the binding interaction by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the full-length VASA and a synthetic peptide identical to the 30 amino-acid stretch of VASA interacted with GUS with nearly the same and significantly high affinity (apparent dissociation constants (KDs) of approximately 40 nM) (Figure 4B).
1|GUS interacts with ElonginBC through the BC box, and in this ternary complex, the three proteins are linearly arranged (Figure 1A). The BC box of the C-terminal SOCS box forms the third alpha-helix and interacts with Elongin C of the ElonginBC complex (Figure 1A).
1|A (His)6-tag pull-down experiment showed that full-length VASA binds GUS tightly.
1|The acetyltransferase activity of (His)6-hARD1 using HIF-1&amp;#945; fragments, a radioactive band corresponding to the position of hARD1 was observed by SDS&#150;PAGE autoradiography, implying that a radioactive acetyl group had been transferred onto (His)6-hARD1 itself (Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B).
0|shows that there was a large increase in the binding of hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 to eIF4E following p53 induction
1|FOXM1c(T600A/T611A/S638A) interacted with GST-Cyclin E but not with GST in pull-down assays, indicating that the interaction with Cyclin E is independent of the phosphorylation sites (Fig. 4E).
1|FOXM1c(T600A/T611A/S638A) was also poorly phosphorylated, strongly suggesting that these 3 sites are targeted in vitro by Cyclin E/CDK2
1|The MdmX&#150;pRB interaction was also observed in p53&amp;#8722;/&amp;#8722;Mdm2&amp;#8722;/&amp;#8722; MEFs (Fig. 3D)
1|As shown in Fig. 3A, endogenous pRB in U2OS cells and HCT116 cells were co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous MdmX in these cells.
1|Furthermore, ectopically expressed MdmX was also able to bind to both wild-type pRB and its C-terminal region (RB-X/N, Fig. 1A) in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B)
1|When GST-importin alpha1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 fusion proteins were incubated with cell lysate containing MDMX, importin alpha3 showed significant binding to MDMX (Liu et al, 2005), which was abrogated by the K468E mutation (Figure 7C).
1|To determine whether MDMX also interacts with other 14-3-3 isoforms, MDMX was cotransfected with the entire 14-3-3 panel (tau, sigma, beta, gamma, zeta, alt epsilon, eta). The epitope tagged 14-3-3 was immunoprecipitated and the co-precipitated MDMX was detected by Western blot. The results showed absence of binding to 14-3-3sigma, weak binding to gamma, and strong binding to tau, beta, zeta, alt epsilon, and eta (Figure 1C).
1|HeLa cells were stably transfected with FLAG-tagged MDMX. When FLAG-MDMX was purified by immunoprecipitation, two proteins reproducibly copurified with MDMX (Figure 1A). Peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry determined the 34 kDa protein as casein kinase 1 alpha, and the 24 kDa protein as 14-3-3tau isoform.
1|Endogenous MDMX interaction with 14-3-3 was nearly below our detection limit in the absence of stress. However, DNA-damaging treatments with camptothecin or ionizing irradiation significantly stimulated MDMX&#150;14-3-3tau binding (Figure 1B).
1|The MDMX mutants were coexpressed with FLAG-14-3-3tau in H1299 cells and analyzed by anti-FLAG IP followed by MDMX Western blot. The results showed that MDMX binding to 14-3-3 was abrogated by the S367A mutation and significantly reduced by P369S mutation (Figure 2B).
1|The result showed that peptide with phosphorylated S367 specifically captured 14-3-3tau from the extract. Unphosphorylated S367 peptide, phosphorylated or unphosphorylated S342 peptides showed no binding above background noise (Figure 2C).
1|Figure 4A shows that gamma-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 inhibits the EphB-induced recruitment of HA-tagged Grb4 (Chen et al, 2000) to ephrinB.
1|Figure 5A shows that this construct co-IPs with Src kinase (upper panels) and the reverse is true, Src co-IPs with construct ephrinB2/CTF2-myc3 (lower panels).
1|Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments showed that ephrinB forms complexes with PS1 (Figure 1 in Supplementary data).
1|Expression of GFP-Dlg1-I3 with E4-ORF1, however, caused both proteins to translocate to the plasma membrane in approx70% of transfected cells (Figure 5D)
1|Given that PDZ1+2 was both necessary and sufficient to mediate Dlg1 binding to E4-ORF1 (Figure 4C), the defects of the latter Dlg1 mutants likely reflect nearly complete or complete disruption of this interaction.
1|Comparable binding of E4-ORF1 to the Dlg1-I2, -I3, -I1I2, and -I1I3 isoforms (Figure 3A).
1|The binding of HIF-1alpha to VHL or PHDs was largely decreased under hypoxia or in the presence of MTA1 (Figures 7A and B). Similar results were obtained when the ODD domain of HIF-1alpha was tested (Figure 7C). When the expression of MTA1 was suppressed by si-MTA1, these bindings and the amount of acetylated HIF-1alpha were significantly increased (Figure 7C), indicating that MTA1 plays a major role in the control of HIF-1alpha stability.
1|The immunoprecipitation results show that MTA1 interacted with each ODD, ID, and CTAD domain, but not with the N-terminus that contained amino acids 1&#150;401, which is known to bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Figure 3C).
1|As shown in Figure 3A, MTA1 and HIF-1alpha were reciprocally co-precipitated in the presence of CoCl2.
1|We examined the association between HIF-1alpha, MTA1, and HDAC1 under hypoxic conditions (Figure 4C). HDAC1 and HIF-1alpha were efficiently co-precipitated, indicating that these proteins are capable of forming a complex in vivo under hypoxic conditions.
1|the level of Red-HIF-1alpha was enhanced and it accumulated in the nucleus when MTA1 was cotransfected (Figure 2E).The nuclear localization of MTA1 and HIF-1alpha was further confirmed in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by Western blot analysis as shown in Figure 2F. These results demonstrate that MTA1 increases HIF-1alpha at the protein level, particularly in the nucleus, and suggest that MTA1 and HIF-1alpha may interact and colocalize in the nucleus.
1|we expressed c-Fos, c-Jun and ATF2 as fusion proteins with either VN173 or VC155 in COS-1 cells. Although fluorescent signals derived from JunVN173&#150;FosVC155 and JunVN173&#150;JunVC155 were localized, as predicted, in the nucleus (Figure 1A and B), 90% of fluorescent signals derived from ATF2VN173&#150;ATF2VC155 were located in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, we observed that the BiFC signals derived from JunVN173&#150;ATF2VC155 were located equally in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas the majority of JunYN155&#150;ATF2YC155 was localized in the cytoplasm when YFP fragments were used (Hu et al, 2002).
1|MDMX bound to 14-3-3gamma more efficiently than to the sigma, tau, alt epsilon, beta, or zeta isoforms, as tested using IP with anti-Flag (Figure 2A).
1|Using the purified antibody, we found that it detected the phosphorylated species of MDMX by Chk1, but not by its KD mutant, in vitro (Figure 6B).
1|Endogenous MDMX and 14-3-3gamma were coimmunoprecipitated with the anti-14-3-3gamma or anti-MDMX, but not anti-His, antibody from 293 cells (Figure 2C).
1|(Figure 3A): Indeed, MDMX bound to GST-14-3-3gamma (lane 2), but not GST alone (lane 1). This binding was reduced by a 15-mer peptide that contains the serine-phosphorylated 14-3-3-binding consensus sequence RSASpEP, but not by its nonphosphorylated counterpart, in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). The same result was obtained when a serine-phosphorylated 15-mer peptide containing the sequence 363RRTISpAP369 derived from MDMX was used under the same experimental setting (Figure 3B).
1|MDMX bound to 14-3-3gamma more efficiently than to the sigma, tau, alt epsilon, beta, or zeta isoforms, as tested using IP with anti-Flag (Figure 2A) and anti-GFP (Figure 2B).
1|MDMX bound to 14-3-3gamma more efficiently than to the sigma, tau, alt epsilon, beta, or zeta isoforms, as tested using IP with anti-Flag (Figure 2A) and anti-GFP (Figure 2B) (see Supplementary Figure S1 for 14-3-3alt epsilon; data for beta and zeta isoforms are not shown).
1|Our in vitro kinase assay showed that UNC-01 effectively inhibited Chk1 activity on p53. In all, 300 nM of the inhibitor led to 80% reduction of p53 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S4a).
1|MDMX bound to 14-3-3gamma more efficiently than to the sigma, tau, alt epsilon, beta, or zeta isoforms, as tested using IP with anti-Flag (Figure 2A).  Mutation of either S367 or P369 in MDMX completely abolished the interaction between MDMX and 14-3-3gamma (Figure 3C). In an experiment similar to that shown in Figure 3C, except the K50E mutant, we found that this mutant failed to bind MDMX in cells (Figure 3D).
1|The almost equimolar concentrations of SSH1L-(Myc+His) mutants purified from cell lysates were subjected to an in vitro F-actin co-sedimentation assay (Fig. 1C). The assays revealed that the full-length (FL) SSH1L almost completely co-sedimented with F-actin
1|we fractionated nuclear proteins by chromatography on phosphocellulose, MonoQ and Superose 6HR and monitored co-purification of NM1 on immunoblots (Fig 2A).

1|Cellular NM1 was found to co-elute with WSTF and SNF2h in fractions containing protein assemblies with an apparent molecular mass of 2&#150;3 MDa.
1|A stronger association of NM1 with the WSTF&#150;SNF2h complex was observed in nuclear extracts (Fig 2C,D), consistent with NM1 associating with WICH in a dynamic fashion, and high protein concentrations stabilizing the interaction of NM1 with WSTF.
1|The results in Fig 2B show that NM1 co-precipitated with WSTF from fractions containing 2&#150;3 MDa but not approx1 MDa complexes.
1|NMI colocalized with Pol I and green fluorescent protein&#150;RPA53, a protein that decorates the active subpopulation of Pol I (Fig 1B).
1|The results in Fig 2B show that NM1 co-precipitated with WSTF from fractions containing 2&#150;3 MDa but not approx1 MDa complexes. Conversely, SNF2h was co-precipitated from both fractions (Fig 2B). A stronger association of NM1 with the WSTF&#150;SNF2h complex was observed in nuclear extracts (Fig 2C,D),
1|In line with these data pointing to an interaction of ErbB2 with EGFR, phospho-ErbB2 was coimmunoprecipitated with phospho-EGFR from lysates of EGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 2C, left panel). Surprisingly, ErbB2 was coprecipitated with EGFR even in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2C, right panel, lane 3)

1|NMR spectroscopy analysis of the C-Mad2:O-Mad2 interaction
1|The interaction can be visualized using a GST pull-down assay (De Antoni et al, 2005a) in which C-Mad2 is created by a 1&#150;2 h incubation of wild-type Mad2 (Mad2wt) with GST-Cdc20111-138 (which contains the Mad2-binding region of Cdc20) immobilized onto glutathione&#150;sepharose (GSH) beads (Figure 2A). As O-Mad2, we resort to using Mad2DeltaC, a Mad2 deletion mutant lacking the last 10 C-terminal residues. Mad2DeltaC is locked as O-Mad2 and is unable to bind Cdc20 stably(Figure 2B, lane 5).
1|F3:Rat brain lysates (2 mg) (A)were preincubated with 100 &amp;#956;M GDP or 100 &amp;#956;M GTP&amp;#947;S and 25 mM MgCl2 at 24 &#176;C for 30 min prior to immunoprecipitation.

1|Immunoprecipitation was used to monitor the interaction between NMT1 and m-calpain using NMT1 antibody. We observed the interaction of NMT1 with m-calpain in normal, tumor and HT29 samples (Fig. 3A, lanes 1&#150;3).

1|We examined the interaction of Bcl2 with NMT1 and NMT2 by immunoprecipitation analysis in human normal, tumor and HT29 samples (Fig. 4B). In this experiment, Bcl2 interacted with NMT2 (Fig. 4B, lanes 4&#150;6).
1|To study the protein&#150;protein interaction of NMTs with caspase-3, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation analysis. We observed that the NMT2 interacts with caspase-3 in normal and cancerous samples (Fig. 3B, lanes 4&#150;6.
1|Deletion mutational analyses revealed that the minimum binding domain of Asf1 for p60, histones H3/H4, and HIRA was confined to 1-155 aa, which lacks a Ser- and Thr-rich region of the C-terminal tail.
1|Deletion mutational analyses revealed that the minimum binding domain of Asf1 for p60, histones H3/H4, and HIRA was confined to 1-155 aa, which lacks a Ser- and Thr-rich region of the C-terminal tail.

1|Full-length HA-tagged mTOR that had been overexpressed in 293T cells could be captured by incubating extracts with a GST-eIF3f affinity resin (Figure 1B).
1|The interaction between wild-type eIF4G and eIF4E was readily detected by using m7GTP-agarose to capture eIF4G&#150;eIF4E complexes (Figure 4A).
1|The interaction between wild-type eIF4G and eIF4E was readily detected by coimmunoprecipitating FLAG-eIF4E (Figure 4B).
1|immunoprecipitations were conducted using antibodies to either eIF3b or eIF4G, and immunoblots were prepared with antibodies to the three eIF4F subunits and to three of the eIF3 subunits (Figure 2C). eIF4G was readily detected in immune complexes isolated with eIF3b antibodies, as were eIF4A and eIF4E.
1|Binding of eIF3 to the 40S ribosomal subunit was evident from the coimmunoprecipitation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) and eIF3 (Figure 5A).
1|eIF4B detected by immunoblotting had the same electrophoretic mobility as the silver-stained band, and treating cells with insulin decreased the amount of eIF4B that coimmunoprecipitated with eIF3 (Figure 6C).
1|To investigate the possible effect of eIF4B on eIF4G binding to eIF3, HA-tagged forms of eIF4B and eIF4G were overexpressed in 293T cells. HA-eIF4B was without effect on the amount of HA-eIF4G that coimmunoprecipitated with eIF3 (Figure 6D).
1|Stringent screening of a 3T3-L1 adipocyte yeast two-hybrid library with bait containing a COOH terminal fragment of mTOR (CTmTOR) yielded three hits: a protein similar to ubiquitin-specific protease 34 (XP_483996), a hypothetical single-strand nucleotide-binding protein (XP_127811), and eIF3f. XP_483996 and XP_127811 were not pursued.
1|The amount of HA-eIF3f recovered with the mTOR affinity resin was much greater than that retained by the GST resin (Figure 1A), indicative of an interaction between the mTOR fragment and eIF3f.

1|GST-pull down: This interaction is shown in fig. 2 as control (BoNT/B and BoNT/G were recently demonstrated to adhere to the membrane juxtaposed region of Syt [7] and [9]).
1|Of the proteins analysed only GST-SV2C-454&#150;603 was capable of pulling down an HC-fragment, BoNT/A HC. The specificity of the newly discovered BoNT/A-SV2C interaction was corroborated by corresponding experiments employing 35S-labelled HC-fragments that lack affinity tags. Again binding was only observed between SV2C and BoNT/A HC (see Fig. 1C).  The results depicted in Fig. 2 show that BoNT/A HC binds to GST-SV2C-454&#150;603 and GST-SV2C-454&#150;579, the latter one just lacking the transmembrane domain, but not to any further truncated SV2C variant.
1|Co-immunoprecipitation (see Fig. 1C) confirms that delF508-CFTR and calnexin form a complex in the ER prevented by miglustat and to a lesser extent by castanospermine.
1|Analysis of CFTR immunoprecipitation on calnexin Western blot showed the delF508-CFTR/calnexin interaction (see Fig. 1A).
1|Fig. 1A shows that TA205, but not an isotype-matched mouse IgG, dose-dependently inhibited the binding of &amp;#945;IIb&amp;#946;3 to both talin and the talin head fragment.  Again, Fig. 1B shows that TA205, but not mouse IgG, inhibited &amp;#945;IIb&amp;#946;3 binding to 8d4-captured full-length talin by ~50%.
1|As shown in Fig. 2A, TA205 had no effect on the apparent Kd value of &amp;#945;IIb&amp;#946;3&#150;talin head interaction, which was estimated by half saturation binding to be not, vert, similar12 nM input &amp;#945;IIb&amp;#946;3.
1|tail&quot; peptides that represented either the non-modified or the me3K9-modified NH2-terminal region of H3 exhibited marginal binding to HP1beta at 0.3 M salt and did not compete with the full-length protein, even at a 200 molar excess.
1|this fragment can be assigned to the stretch extending between amino acids 40-129, i.e. the so-called &quot;histone fold&quot; domain. Thus, at least under in vitro conditions, HP1beta has the capacity to bind histone H3 independently of post-translational modifications, associating primarily with the central, helical part of the molecule.
1|The analysis of 4,480 images of large particles resulted in class averages that clearly showed a two-fold symmetry axis consistent with a2/b2 tetramers
1|When TFIIE (Fig 3A, lane 1) was chemically crosslinked with 0.02% glutaraldehyde, a single polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of 90 kDa corresponding to the a/b heterodimer was generated, whereas no band of higher molecular mass was detected (Fig 3A, lane 2).
1|We next estimated the binding affinity for the interactions between TEM7 ectodomain and nidogen-Fc in an equilibrium binding experiment (Fig. 2B). Specific binding of eTEM7-AP to purified nidogen-Fc showed saturation, yielding values for the Kd of 10.4 nM.
1|This experiment demonstrated that nickel beads specifically co-precipitated the eTEM7-AP protein and nidogen-Fc, which could be detected by a polyclonal anti-human IgG antibody (Fig. 2A).
1|Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting also revealed that the interactions between HSP60 and Bax were decreased by 62.2% (&#177;3.6) under hyperglycemic conditions relative to the normoglycemic control (Fig. 5B and D).
1|Flag-tagged EKLF and HA-tagged ubiquitin were transiently co-expressed in 293T cells and subsequently immunoprecipitated in the presence of NEM and iodoacetamide, which inhibit the deubiquitinating isopeptidase enzymes within the cell. Subsequent immunoblot analysis indicates that EKLF is ubiquitinated even in the absence of MG132 (Fig. 3A).
1|Fig 1B,C shows BRET signal between Grb14&#150;YFP and either IR&#150;Rluc or a kinase-dead mutant of the IR fused to luciferase (IR-K1030A&#150;RLuc).
1|YFP&#150;PTP1B-D181A was precipitated with an anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody, and the amount of IR co-immunoprecipitated with PTP1B was evaluated using an anti-IRb antibody.
1|To determine whether the interaction of the IR and Grb14 can be monitored by BRET, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with IR&#150;Rluc and Grb14&#150;yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion proteins. In the absence of insulin, a low basal BRET signal could be detected. Insulin rapidly and dose-dependently increased this signal (Fig 1A).
1|We therefore analysed the effect of Grb14 on IRS-1 recruitment to the IR. HEK cells were co-transfected with YFP-tagged IR (IR&#150;YFP), IRS-1, PTP1B-wt and Grb14. The IR was immunoprecipitated using an anti-GFP antibody (Fig 4A). The amount of IRS-1 coprecipitated with the activated IR was markedly reduced in cells co-transfected with Grb14
1|Analysis of WASP&#150;CIB binding using the surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor, BIACORE 3000 (BIACORE, Piscataway, NJ, USA), indicated that the WASP N terminus bound directly to the CIB N terminus (supplementary Fig S1 online).
1|When cells were transfected with CIB, CIB co-immunoprecipitated with WASP (Fig 2A, lane 14), indicating that WASP binds to CIB in transfected cells.
1|We examined whether WASP binds to CIB in platelets CIB was detected only in immunoprecipitates obtained from lysates of stimulated platelets in a time-dependent manner, but not resting platelets
1|WASP binding to CIB was blocked by the CIB Nterminal fragment in cells (supplementary Fig S9A, lane 4).
1|In cells expressing CIB, both CIB and WASP co-immunoprecipitated with aIIb (Fig 2D, lanes 4,6).
1|WIP co-immnunoprecipitated with WASP in the lysates from both resting and stimulated platelets (supplementary Fig S9B).
1|WASP was also detected only in anti-CIB immunoprecipitates obtained from lysates of stimulated platelets (supplementary Fig S10 online).
1|To determine the role of the WASP N terminus in platelet aggregation, we undertook a yeast two-hybrid screen using the WASP N-terminal domain as bait and isolated a complementary DNA encoding the calcium- and integrin-binding protein (CIB).  We found that the binding site for CIB on WASP resided in the WASP N terminus (residues 1&#150;105) and that WASP binding required the CIB N terminus (residues 1&#150;113; Fig 1A)
1|Colocalization between Mac-1 and LRP on the surface of macrophages from WTand deficient mice  Confocal fluorescence images of migrating macrophages from the WT mice showed strong colocalization between LRP and Mac-1
1|We next examined whether LRP directly associates with Mac-1. To test this, we conducted reciprocal co-IP experiments using mAbs against LRP or Mac-1 for immunoprecipitation (IP) and antibodies against the 95 kDa b-subunit of Mac-1 or the 85 kDa subunit of LRP for immunoblots. These data indicated that Mac-1 is precipitated as a complex with LRP, and that this association is partially blocked with RAP (Figure 4D). Reciprocally, LRP could be precipitated with a mAb (M1/70) specific for Mac-1 but not by a control IgG, confirming specificity
1|Paip2 ubiquitination was measured by capturing His-Ub from cell extracts with TALON metal affinity resin under denaturing conditions, and detecting ubiquitinated Paip2 by an anti-Paip2 antibody. This assay revealed a stronger ubiquitination of Paip2 (that barely entered the gel) in PABP-depleted cells (Figure 4). These results indicate that endogenous Paip2 is polyubiquitinated in response to PABP depletion prior to its degradation by the proteasome  His-tagged ubiquitinated proteins were purified using TALON metal affinity resin and anti-Paip2 antibody was used to detect ubiquitinated Paip2 (Ubn-Paip2).

1|When the P/Q-charged region was deleted, Brm lost its ability to bind specifically GST-Tat, while Brm lacking its bromodomain was still able to interact (Figure 3B).
1|The acetyltransferase P300, another known Tat cofactor, also specifically interacted with Tat (Figure 1A).
1|The four core subunits of the SWI/SNF complex were found to specifically associate with Tat (Figure 2A).The domain of Tat able to bind Brm was mapped between amino acids 40 and 72 of Tat, corresponding to its RNA-binding domain (Figure 2B and C).
1|HA-Brm was specifically immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody only in cells expressing Tat-Flag.
1|GST-Brm-charged, but not GST, interacted with Tat-Flag WT and Tat-Flag K50R but not Tat-Flag K50Q, suggesting that the conservation of positive charge is important for this interaction (Figure 8A).
1|The Tat-Flag protein expressed in 293 cells was able to bind efficiently to the charged domain of Brm (Figure 3C).
0|Tat bound endogenous Brm, the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF complex.

This siRNA induced the silencing of p400 expression at the mRNA level (Figure 2A) as well as at the protein level, as shown by the disappearance of a faint 400 kDa band recognised by the anti-p400 antibody and of coprecipitating Tip49b (lower panel) in p400 immunoprecipitates (Figure 2B).
1|As shown in Figure 3B, the exocyst subunits Exo70, Sec8 and Sec6 co-precipitated predominantly with AMPARs, but only to low levels with NMDARs.
1|The exocyst also co-precipitated the PDZ protein PSD95 (Figure 3A).
1|As shown in Figure 3A, immunoprecipitation of the exocyst subunits Sec8 or Exo70 co-precipitated AMPARs.

1|We found that Sld3 associated with Mcm4 before initiation (Figure 2Aa, Sld3, G1+X-linker) but not in cells containing only forks (Figure 2Aa, Sld3, HU+X-linker).
0|Figure 2A: Cdc45 interacts unstably (or indirectly) with MCM before initiation and interacts stably with MCM after initiation.
1|Psf2 was found to associate with Mcm4 after initiation even in cells that had not been treated with formaldehyde (Figure 2Ab HU-X-linker).
1|We also carried out a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment using 293T cell lysates that contained ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged Arkadia and HA-tagged Axin (Figure 1C). The results also demonstrate that Axin and Arkadia strongly interact with each other.
1|Figure 4(A): Axin colocalized with Arkadia.
1|Axin interacted with Smad7, as strongly as with Smad3 (Figure 2A).
1|As shown in Figure 2C, Arkadia was present in the final immunoprecipitate but not in the control sample, indicating that Axin, Smad7, and Arkadia are in a ternary complex.
1|Ubiquitination of Smad7 was enhanced in cells overexpressing increasing amounts of Axin (Figure 6A and B). Axin-induced Smad7 polyubiquitination was blocked by ArkadiaDeltaC in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6C), suggesting that the latter exerts a dominant-negative effect on the Axin-induced polyubiquitination of Smad7.
1|Figure 3C: These results demonstrate that Axin requires both its N-terminal region (aa 1&#150;183) and C-terminal region of aa 507&#150;757 for maximal interaction with Smad7.
1|shown in Figure 3D, among all the Smad7 mutants, only M1 that lacks both the N- and C-terminal regions failed to interact with Axin. Smad7 therefore appears to possess two domains for interaction with Axin, with either N- or MH2 domains alone capable of forming complex with Axin.
0|One of the clones such identified (designated as AIP7 for Axin-Interacting Protein 7) encodes an amino-acid sequence corresponding to aa (amino acids) 83&#150;433 of Arkadia (Figure 1A).
1|Fig4(B): Axin induces cytoplasmic translocation of Smad7 and colocalized with Smad7 in the cytoplasm.
1|Axin also bound to Smad6 (Figure 2A).
1|To verify this, we carried out interaction assays by co-immunoprecipitation between Axin and separately Arkadia, Smad7, along with Smad3, Smad3D407E, and Smurf1, after cotransfection with or without caTbRI as indicated (Figure 7A).
1|We also carried out GST pulldown experiment (Figure 1D). The results also demonstrate that Axin and Arkadia strongly interact with each other.
1|When cotransfected with FLAG-ArC937A, full-length Axin was strongly co-immunoprecipitated with Arkadia. Axin deletion mutants C1, N2, and M1 retained their ability to form a complex with Arkadia, albeit with lower affinity compared to full-length Axin. However, Axin deletion mutants N1, C2, and DeltaAr lost their ability to interact with Arkadia, indicating that the region around aa 507&#150;757 in Axin is critical for Arkadia interaction.
1|Axin enhances the interaction of Arkadia with Smad7 (Figure 2D).
1|Immunoprecipitation using endogenous proteins in 293T cells also indicated that Axin interacts with Smad7 (Figure 2B).
1|Figure S2. Interaction of Axin2/Conductin with Arkadia and Smad7.
1|As shown in Figure 1B, Axin was readily detected in the precipitate by anti-Arkadia, and Arkadia detected in the immunoprecipitate of Axin, indicating that Axin indeed interacts with Arkadia at their endogenous levels.
0|In contrast, the stoichiometry of a shorter p47 fragment, comprising the SEP&#150;UBX domains, was found to be of 1 p47 fragment bound to 1 p97 protomer
1|Furthermore, analytical ultracentrifugation data presented in this study provides additional evidence for full-length p47 existing as a trimer (Supplementary Figure 1B).
1|We have obtained cryomicrographs of p97&#150;p47 complex in the presence of ADP or AMPPNP (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table I). Manual picking of single particles was straightforward because of the good contrast of the particles (Figure 2A)
1|A ratio of 0.5 p47 monomer to 1 p97 protomer was observed with a Kd of 0.5 mM confirming that three p47 bind to a hexameric p97 (Figure 1C)
1|Scanning transmission electron microscopy mass measurements also confirm that the particles are no larger than a p97 hexamer in complex with 3 p47 (data not shown) consistent with the calorimetric data and analysis of the complex by native gel electrophoresis (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 2A).
1|Purified vacuoles bearing Vps33-SBP were lysed in detergent and subjected to streptavidin affinity chromatography. Only the other five known HOPS complex subunits co-purified at high levels with SBP-tagged Vps33 (Figure 1).
1|HOPS complex from vacuole lysates showed the strongest interaction with GST-Vam7p (Figure 7A).
0|Here we describe the identification of a novel protein complex, the MLL2 complex, consisting of MLL2, ASH2, RBQ3, and WDR5, which is required for ligand-dependent ER{alpha} transactivation
0|These results suggest that ER{alpha} binds to the MLL2 complex through two LXXLL motifs in MLL2 (located between amino acids 4167 and 4780) in the presence of estrogen.
1|In 293T cells, IKK-a co-immunoprecipitated with IRF-7
1|in Flt3L-induced BMDCs and IRF-7- expressing BMDCs induced with granulocyte&#150;macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), IKK-a was detected in IRF-7 immunoprecipitates, but not in control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 5a). This association was observed before stimulation; after stimulation with TLR7/9 agonists, the amount of co-immunoprecipitated IKK-a increased, and was accompanied by an increase in IRF-7 protein levels
1|IKK-b was also co-immunoprecipitatied in anti-IRF-7 immunoprecipitates, and the co-immunoprecipitated amount increased after stimulation
1|IKK-b was also co-immunoprecipitatied in anti-IRF-7 immunoprecipitates, and the co-immunoprecipitated amount increased after stimulation; in contrast, IKK-g was hardly detected.
1|n the reverse IP experiment (IP with anti-PCNA antibodyand blot with anti-p21 antibody) (Fig. 8B) the results confirm that PCNA and p21 waf associated only following 48 h drug treatment.
1|Fig.7: Co-localization of p53 and p21 waf is visible as yellow staining generated where the color images merge. At 48 h of incubation, while 5% of control cells showed a strong nuclear co-localization of p53 and p21, in cells treated with 2 and 6 nM of Taxol the percentage increased to 15% and 50%, respectively.
1|As shown in Fig. 8A, PCNA protein was present in immunoprecipitates from MCF-7 cells treated for 48 h with 12, 25 and 100 nM of Taxol.
1|P53 uses dynein to translocate into the nucleus since it co-immunoprecipitates with the microtubule-motor protein and with b-tubulin(Fig. 6).
1|In order to test whether endogenous CKIe co-localizes with occludin, HUVECs were co-stained with antibodies to occludin and CKIe. Both occludin and CKIe were detected at cell borders with a similar staining pattern, indicative of co-localization (Fig. 4).
1|Endogenous CKIe and occludin co-precipitated from HUVECs (Fig. 3), indicating that the proteins interact in vivo.
1|The interactions between these clones and cOcc were verified using a different yeast strain (Fig. 1A and B). The inserts in C1, F1 and H2 were sequenced and found to encode regions of SKI-interacting protein(C1), casein kinase 1e (CK1e; F1) and Unc-51-like kinase H2) (Fig. 1C).
1|GST-cOcc was able to pull-down CKIa from HUVEC lysates (Fig. 2), as predicted based on the sequence homology between CKIa and CKIe.
1|In order to confirm the interaction between cOcc and CKIe,GST pull-down experiments were performed. Two bands were detected by the CKIe antibody in HUVEC lysates. Of these two bands, only the slower migrating band bound to GST-cOcc.
1|Wild-type CKIe phosphorylated the 60 kDa GST-cOcc and phosvitin but not GST (Fig. 6A). This phosphorylation was absent where no CKIe was present in the reaction, and where kinase-dead CKIe was used, confirming that the phosphorylation was performed by CKIe and not by contaminating kinases.
1|we observed a strong association of pSSU with a Toc64DTPR affinity matrix
0|We obtained an interaction of the major guidance complex component 14-3-3 with Toc34,

1|the association of the nucleotide transport protein 1 (pNTT1), the precursor of the malate dehydrogenase (pMDH), ferredoxin (pFd) or plastocyanine 1 (pPC) with the different Toc64 polypeptides was analysed (Figure 2D and F). Like for pOE33, an association of wgt-pNTT1, pPC with the TPR was observed.
0|association of Toc64 with either Toc159 or Toc34.
1|wgt-pSSU, wgt-pOE33 or rlt-pOE33 (pOE33-r, Figure 4H) were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against 14-3-3 (lane 5), Hsp70 (lane 3) or Hsp90 (lane 4). All proteins were precipitated by Hsp70 antibodies, but only pSSU by 14-3-3 antibodies.
1|Using purified proteins, an interaction of Toc64 with Toc34GMP-PNP, but not with Toc159GMP-PNP (Figure 9C, lane 2) could be established
1|The interaction between 14-3-3 and import components were further confirmed by incubation of purified Toc34 and 14-3-3 in solution and subsequent co-immunoprecipitation by a14-3-3 or aToc34 antibodies
1|Replacing arginine 550 facing the chaperone binding pocket within Toc64TPR by alanine (Figure 6B, 5th helix, red) reduces the interaction of Toc64TPR with Hsp90 or Hsp70 from wheat germ lysate

1|Cdc48p was specifically co-precipitated with Hrd1p-HA, HA-Hrd3p,
1|To examine complex formation between Sld2 and Dpb11, we first set up an in vitro protein&#150;protein binding assay. In a twohybrid assay, Sld2-P1 (residues 79&#150;263), which contains all the CDK-phosphorylation motifs, interacted with Dpb11. The region of Sld2 interacting with Dpb11 in a twohybrid assay.A C-terminal portion of Dpb11 (Dpb11-C; residues 291&#150;631) containing a pair of BRCT domains interacted with Sld2 (Figure 1D). The interaction region of Dpb11 with Sld2 in a twohybrid assay.
1|Furthermore, although the T84A protein showed the slow migrating form in SDS&#150; PAGE, it did not interact with Dpb11 in a two-hybrid assay or co-precipitate with Dpb11 (Figures 3E and 4A).  The Sld2-10Flag was precipitated from HU-arrested HMS65 (pep4DHG418rdrc1-1 DPB11-9myc) cells harbouring YCp22SLD2-10FLAG (WT) or YCp22SLD2-10FLAG bearing a T84A mutation (T84A) as described in (A). Co-precipitation of Dpb11-9myc was detected by anti-myc 9E10 antibody.
1|The sld2 mutations at CDK-phosphorylation motifs used for two-hybrid assays and for plasmid-shuffling assays to examine the ability to support cell growth.  As shown in Figure 4A, a simultaneous alanine substitution of serine or threonine residues at all the canonical CDK-phosphorylation motifs (6A) abolished interaction with Dpb11 (Figure 4A).
0|Complex formation between Flag-Sld2-P1 (residues 79&#150;263) and GST-Dpb11-C (residues 291&#150;631) in vitro  This result further suggests that phosphorylated Sld2 and Dpb11 can form a complex in the absence of other proteins.
1|Immunostaining of immunoprecipitated (IP) MRLC with antibody against ubiquitin confirmed that PDGF induced ubiquitination of MRLC (Figure 3B and C).
1|Intriguingly, MRLC phosphorylated at threonine 18 and serine 19 copurified with MIR in immunoprecipitates from PDGFstimulated, but not from -untreated cells (Figure 4C).
0|Sequence analysis revealed 7 of the 17 positive clones contained a cDNA encoding the C-terminus of an adapter protein previously named APPL or DIP13
1|Identification of APPL1 as an AdpioR1 interacting protein
1|Endogenous AdipoR1 interacted with GST-APPL1c but not with GST control protein.
1|Immunoprecipitated APPL1 and coimmunoprecipitated AdipoR1 were detected with the antibodies to the proteins.
0|CeBRD-1 is ubiquitylated in the CeBCD complex
1|Under normal growth conditions, BRCA1 immuno-precipitates from soluble and chromatin bound MCF7 cell extracts contain very low levels of UbcH5c (Figure 4A, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). In contrast, following IR-treatment, UbcH5c is significantly increased in BRCA1 immuno-precipitates from chromatin bound MCF7 extracts (Figure 4A, lane 4).
1|we have biochemically characterized CeBRD-1 associated proteins (CeBCD complexes) purified by tandem immuno-affinity (Polanowska et al, 2004) (Figure 1A).
1|Beta2-Chimaerin strongly associates with active G12V-Rac1. On the other hand, binding to either the inactive GST-T17N-Rac1 mutant, GST-Rac1 (wild-type) or GST alone was barely detected (Supplementary Figure S2A). Unlike G12V-Rac1, G12V/S189A-Rac1, an activated mutant with impaired geranylgeranylation and membrane targeting, failed to bind to beta2-chimaerin in the pull-down assays (Supplementary Figure S2B).
1|beta2-Chimaerin also co-immunoprecipitates with an active Rac1 mutant (Supplementary Figure S2C).
1|While GFP-beta2-chimaerin did not show a significant degree of colocalization with wild-type Rac1 under serum-free conditions, it colocalized with constitutively active G12V-Rac1 in peripheral ruffles (Figure 5A).
1|When cells coexpressing CFP-Rac1 (wild type) and YFP-beta2-chimaerin (wild type) were subject to EGF treatment, significant FRET was detected in the cell periphery (Figure 2B). Remarkably, under this limiting experimental condition, significant FRET was observed for YFP-fused Q32A- and I130A-beta2-chimaerin mutants (Figure 3D).  Remarkably, in cells coexpressing DeltaEIE-beta2-chimaerin and wild-type Rac1, FRET remained high even at longer time points (Figure 4A and B).
1|While GFP-C1-PKCalpha is localized in the cytoplasm under basal conditions, a significant degree of peripheral colocalization with the activated small G-protein was observed in cells expressing G12V-Rac1 (Figure 5B).
1|(Figure 4A). Wild-type MBP-MA efficiently bound GST-IQGAP1, but not GST, from solution.  MA mutants T4, T5, SMA6, and T11 bound GST-IQGAP1 very poorly or not at all.
1|The minimal region required for strong interaction with MA consisted of residues 1500&#150;1657, including the C-terminus of the protein (Figure 3A). Mutants mt5, 6, and 7 near the N-terminal border showed strongly reduced binding (though mutant mt8 did not); and mutants mt9, 10, 11, and 12 at the very C-terminus were all completely defective for binding, suggesting that the C-terminus of IQGAP1 is essential for the interaction (Figure 3B).
1|To identify the residues of MA required for the interaction with IQGAP1 or the other binding proteins, a series of alanine substitution mutations were introduced into the central portion of the MA coding region in the LexADB-MA construct(Figure 1A).The mutants were tested for their interaction with various Gal4AD fusions identified in the screen (Table I).Binding to IQGAP1 was sensitive to a distinctive set of mutations localized in twoblocks: mutants T1&#150;T6, and mutants T11, SMA6, and SMA8.
1|(Figure 4B). Wild-type Gag bound the full-length IQGAP1 and the C-terminal fragment efficiently, while the T4 mutant Gag bound them much less well.
1|As expected, in control cells, PAK associates with bPIX, GIT1, and GIT2 (Figure 3J).
1|As shown in Figure 3G, under these conditions the association of both GIT1 and GIT2 with paxillin can be readily detected.
1|Figure 3I demonstrates that bPIX immunoprecipitates with both GIT1 and GIT2.
1|Several hundred micrographs were collected of negatively stained ThKaiC, ThKaiA&#150;KaiC, SeKaiC and SeKaiA&#150;KaiC samples. Approximately 4000 particle images were extracted for each sample and class sum images were generated to enhance the features of the particle images (Figure 5A).
1|Upper bands in lanes 3 and 4 of Figure 4A represent complex and middle and lower bands correspond to residual ThKaiC hexamer and ThKaiA dimer, respectively.
0|Similarly, SUMO is detected at a subset of CP190 chromatin binding sites
1|We confirmed this association for Mod(mdg4)2.2 and Ubc9 using a GST pull-down assay (Figure 1D, left panel).
1|A fraction of Mod(mdg4)2.2 sites, which are found exclusively at the border regions, colocalize with SUMO, as revealed by costaining of polytene chromosomes with anti-SUMO and anti-Mod(mdg4)2.2 antisera (Figure 3A)
1|Immunoprecipitations performed from these mitochondrial fractions, revealed the presence of the full length 145-kDa c-Abl which was observed to be associated with the full length 80-kDa PKC&amp;#948; and the 26-kDa Bcl-XL/s (Fig. 6B).
0|The results showed that GSTP1-1 associated with JNK1 in unstimulated cells,

1|As shown in Fig. 2, some annexin A8 co-sediments with F-actin in the presence of Ca2+. Albeit being a minor fraction of the annexin A8 present in the reaction mixture under these conditions, a significant co-pelleting of annexin A8 with the actin filaments is observed consistently.
1|Following stimulation with EGF, cells were incubated with a GST-p85 fusion protein, which allows to precipitate Gab1 only if phosphorylated on PI3K binding sites.
1|All four known constituents of the PS1 complex (nicastrin3, aph-1 (refs 4, 5), pen-2 (ref. 5) and PS1 (ref. 1)) were present only in the co-precipitates from wild-type cells.
1|endogenous TMP21 from mouse brain, neuron-like SHSY-5Y cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells could be co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous nicastrin, aph-1, pen-2 and PS1
0|TMP21 also interacts with the p24 cargo protein p24a, but as a component of a separate complex.
1|p24a, another member of the p24 cargo protein family, does not interact with any members of the presenilin complex but does co-precipitate TMP21.
1|endogenous TMP21 from mouse brain, neuron-like SHSY-5Y cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells could be co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous nicastrin, aph-1, pen-2 and PS1 (Fig. 1a, and Supplementary Fig. 1a) and that it had an overlapping size distribution with presenilin complex components in high-molecular-mass (more than 650-kDa) fractions on glycerol velocity gradients
1|On 2D-gel electrophoresis in wild type cells expressing endogenous proteins, TMP21 is distributed into a series of peaks, some of which overlap those of the mature, functional ~660 kDa PS1 complex, the ~440 kDa immature non-functional complex, and the ~150 kDa nicastrin-aph-1 complex. About 25% of the TMP21 signal resides in the ~660 kDa complex. In contrast, in both PS1/PS2 double knockout cells and in pen-2 knock-down cells, TMP21 is destabilized from the ~660 kDa complex (&lt;5% of signal intensity), and instead, TMP21 is predominantly localized with the ~150 kDa nicastrin:aph-1 complex and in a 30 kDa complex.
1|Importantly, even though Bax was present in one of each of the paired reactions, it co-precipitated with Bcl-2 only from reactions also containing tBid
1|RII overlays performed on HEK293 subcellular fractions identified three major membrane-associated AKAP species (Figure 4A). Immunoblotting with AKAP-specific antibodies identified the proteins as AKAP79, AKAP149 and gravin (AKAP250).
1|Gravin copurified with PDE4D from HEK293 cell extract (Figure 6, upper blot, lane 2), but was not detected in the IgG control (Figure 6, upper blot, lane 1).
1|Immunoblotting analysis of the coprecipitated proteins from NGF-treated nuclear extract reveals that Akt specifically associates with Ebp1 (Figure 3A). Subcellular fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrate that endogenous Ebp1 potently binds nuclear translocated Akt after 10&#150;30 min of NGF stimulation, whereas cytoplasmic Ebp1 weakly associates with Akt at about 10 min (Figure 3H).
1|(Figure 5A). In the absence of EGF stimulation, clear association occurs between Akt and GST-Ebp1 S360D, while no interaction is detected between GST-Ebp1 wild type or S360A and Akt. By contrast, EGF treatment provokes evident binding by Akt to both wild-type Ebp1 and S360D.
1|Immunofluorescent staining on NGF-treated PC12 cells reveals the Ebp1 resides in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and colocalizes with the nuclear Akt. (Figure 5B).
1|Truncation assay with GFP-tagged Ebp1 fragments shows that both N- and C-termini of Ebp1 bind to Akt, and deletion of the N-terminal 48 residues increases Ebp1 binding to Akt (Figure 3F).
1|To assess whether the complex of Ebp1/CAD exist in intact cells, we treated PC12 cells with NGF and performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay with CAD antibody-conjugated beads. NGF treatment provokes Ebp1 to bind CAD. Staurosporine treatment does not alter their association, suggesting that CAD is not required to release from its inhibitory ICAD (Figure 5H).
1|we conducted co-immunoprecipitation assay with Ebp1 antibody in Myc-NLS-Akt stably transfected PC12 cells, treated with NGF in the presence or absence of PI 3-kinase inhibitor Wortmannin or MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. NGF triggers demonstrable association between Ebp1 and Akt, and Wortmannin pretreatment disrupts the interaction. By contrast, PD98059 pretreatment fails to interrupt it (Figure 3D, upper panel).
1|Co-immunoprecipitation assay reveals that Akt-NLS-Myc tightly binds to Ebp1 S360D, followed by wild-type Ebp1. By contrast, no interaction is observed with Ebp1 S360A, supporting that the interaction between Ebp1 and nuclear active Akt is PKC dependent. However, the association between Ebp1 and plasma membrane Akt-myr is negligible (Figure 5C).
1|EGF treatment of HEK293 cells, cotransfected with GST-Akt and Flag-Ebp1, substantially increases the association, suggesting that Akt phosphorylation promotes its interaction with Ebp1 (Figure 3C, top panel).Equal amount of Ebp1 is immunoprecipitated (data not shown). Mapping experiment with GST-tagged Akt fragments reveals that Ebp1 evidently binds the N-terminal PH and catalytic domains of Akt (Figure 3E).
1|Ebp1 T366A mutant is also phosphorylated, indicating that it is not the phosphorylate site by PKC (Figure 4B, upper panel). Kinase assay with a variety of Ebp1 mutants suggests that S360 and S361 residues are responsible for the phosphorylation (Figure 4C, upper panel). Phosphorylation assay with full-length Ebp1 S360A and Ebp1 S361A mutants reveals that serine 360 is the PKC phosphorylation site (Figure 4D, lower panel).
1|Co-immunoprecipitation assay with Ebp1 antibody in PC12 cells, infected with adenovirus expressing Akt-NLS-Myc (Shiraishi et al, 2004) or myristoylated-Akt (Suhara et al, 2002), demonstrates that both plasma membrane and nuclear Akt interacts with Ebp1 in an NGF-dependent manner, but nuclear Akt binds much more Ebp1 than plasma membrane-bound Akt does (Figure 3G, upper panel).
1|We cotransfected Flag-Ebp1 with various wild-type and mutant HA-Akt constructs. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrates that the strongest interaction occurs between Ebp1 and constitutively active Akt (T308DS473D), a phosphorylation mimetic mutant, indicating that active Akt selectively binds to Ebp1. Interestingly, its kinase activity is not required for the binding (Figure 3B, top panel).
1|We found that both WT and I377N-mutant synaptotagmin 2 co-immunoprecipitated with syntaxin-1, SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin-2 (Figures 2E and F).

1|Mud and Pins immunoprecipitated (IP) from wild-type embryonic lysates with anti-Pins antibody but not with non-specific control antibodies.
1|In embryonic neuroblasts, we found that Mud and Pins were both enriched at the cortex over the apical centrosome/spindle pole from late interphase and up to the end of metaphase (Fig. 2a, b, d, e; Fig. 3a).
1|To determine whether Nek2A interacts directly with the APC/C, a human APC/C preparation that was immunopurified using an anti-Apc3 antibody was first western blotted with antibodies against APC/C subunits and Nek2. Nek2A was clearly detected in the purified APC/C preparation, but not in the control immunoprecipitation sample
1|To verify that interaction between the APC/C and Nek2A is dependent on its destruction motifs, radiolabelled Nek2A, Nek2A&amp;#916;K&amp;#8722;&amp;#916;D and both full-length (Cdc13) and nondegradable (Cdc13&amp;#916;67) fission yeast cyclin B were incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts before APC/C immunopurification. Nek2A co-purified with the APC/C, whereas only trace amounts of Nek2A&amp;#916;K&amp;#8722;&amp;#916;D, Cdc13 or Cdc13&amp;#916;67 were co-purified and Nek2. Nek2A was clearly detected in the purified APC/C preparation, but not in the control immunoprecipitation sample
1|We added 35Slabelled Nek2A&amp;#916;K and Nek2A&amp;#916;K&amp;#8722;&amp;#916;MR to CSF extracts and immunopurified the APC/C to assess their ability to bind the Xenopus APC/C. Nek2A-&amp;#916;K, but not Nek2A&amp;#916;K&amp;#8722;&amp;#916;MR, bound to the APC/C in mock-treated CSF extractsand, equally well, to the APC/C in CSF extracts from which Cdc20 (Fizzy) had been depleted
1|peptides representing the C-terminal 25 amino acids of Nek2A with or without the terminal MR dipeptide were used to bind the APC/C in CSF extracts. Again, the full-length peptide, but not the &amp;#916;MR peptide, could bind Xenopus APC/C in untreated and Cdc20 (Fizzy)-depleted extracts equally well

1|A total of 26 clones were finally retained at this stage and nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNAs revealed that they corresponded to 12 different genes. Two of them corresponded to already known Krox20 cofactors, Nab1 and Nab2 (Russo et al, 1995; Svaren et al, 1996) (two and six clones, respectively), indicating that the two-hybrid selection was performed appropriately.
1|&amp;#65279;When both expression vectors were cotransfected, the nuclear distribution of Krox20 was modified towards a punctuated pattern, largely overlapping with that of PIASxb (Figure 1C). These data suggest that Krox20 and PIASxb colocalize when they are coexpressed, owing to sequestering of Krox20 by PIASxb in nuclear bodies.
0|Krox20 interacts with PIASxb
1|As shown in Figure 1B, GST-Krox20, but not GST alone, specifically retained PIASxb. These data establish that Krox20 and PIASxb can interact in vitro and that the interaction is direct.
1|We also performed immunoprecipitation analyses on cotransfected COS7 cells, which revealed the presence of PIASxb among the proteins precipitated with an antibody directed against Krox20 (Figure 1D).
0|The Rad7-containing E3 ligase complex ubiquitinates Rad4 in vitro
1|The physical interaction of Rad7, Rad16, Elc1, and Cul3 proteins was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation.
1|Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that Pax6 bound Brg1 (Figure 6A) and c-Maf bound Snf2h (Figure 6B).
1|CREB interacted with both Brg1 and Snf2h (Figure 6C and D).

1|In Table 2, it is shown that the generation of the double mutation E310M/D311A in cpSRP43 led to a complete loss of binding to cpSRP54M, whereas all other tested mutations were ineffective.
1|As shown in Fig. 4, cpSRP54M interacts strongly with a single peptide comprising residues 307&#150;321.
1|we verified by in vitro pulldown experiments using GST-cpSRP43 or GST-cpSRP43(E310M, D311A) that the mutation prevented binding to cpSRP54M (Fig. 2).
1|(Table 1). The KD value for the binding of full-length cpSRP43 and cpSRP54M was estimated to be not, vert, similar2.5 nM, reflecting the high affinity of this interaction. A specific but significantly weaker binding of cpSRP54M to cpSRP43(255&#150;376), encoding CD2/3 and containing 15 additional N-terminal residues, was observed (KD: 29.7 nM).
1|In Table 3, it is shown that the substitution of V308 and V312 with glycine (V308G, V312G) led to a loss of interaction with cpSRP54M, whereas the introduction of the hydrophobic amino acid methionine at these positions (V308M, V312M) and the mutations V306G and L320G did not impair binding to cpSRP54M.
1|In this study, we investigate the changes in the Fe oxidation state &#150; next to possible metal centre perturbations &#150; between free and PSI-bound Cc6 using XAS in fluorescence mode. Under our experimental conditions, a slight shift to lower energies of the Fe2+ absorption edge of Click to view the MathML source is observed when the protein interacts with PSIHg.
1|As shown in Fig 4C, there is a small amount of TNFR1 localized at ER before Tg treatment. But the level of TNFR1 at ER is markedly increased after Tg treatment.
1|Both RIP and IRE1a were coprecipitatedwith TNFR1 in response to Tg treatment, indicating that TNFR1, IRE1a and RIP might form a complex in cells under ER stress.
1|As it is known that IRE1a interacts with TRAF2 and that TRAF2 is a key effector of TNFR1 signalling, we performed similar co-immunoprecipitation experiments in TRAF2-/- fibroblast cells to rule out the possibility that the interaction between IRE1a and TNFR1 is mediated by TRAF2, and similar results to those in Fig 4B were obtained with TRAF2-/- cells
1|partial co-localization between endogenous SETDB1 and exogenous DNMTs
1|DNMT3s (DNMT3A and DNMT3B2) instead of DNMT1 associate with SETDB1.
1|anti-SETDB1 antibody specifically co-immunoprecipitated endogenous DNMT3A
1|GST-fused SETDB1 1-527 (Fig. 3B, staining panel) strongly bound to both exogenous and endogenous DNMT3A (lanes 4-6 and 10-12), indicating that amino acids 1-527 of SETDB1 are responsible for the recruitment of SETDB1 to DNMT3A.
1|an interaction between GST-DNMT3A 477-617 and SETDB1 was observed (lane 4).
0|We investigated this further by examining the effects of various concentrations of DTT between 0 and 100 mM and the results are shown in Fig. 1. As the concentration of DTT present in the assays was increased, so too were the resulting levels of PrrB&#150;P. This confirms that our intact purified protein here is functioning appropriately in response to reducing conditions.
1|Fig. 1 also shows that the higher levels of PrrB&#150;P obtained in these experiments resulted in a concomitant increase in phosphotransfer to PrrA, resulting in higher levels of PrrA&#150;P in our phosphotransfer assays. This therefore confirms that subsequent signal transduction from PrrB to PrrA also occurs successfully under all conditions of DTT used under these in vitro conditions (Fig. 1).
1|The association between Sse1p and Ssa1p was further characterized using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy analyses.
1|To probe the specificity and exclude the possibility of a chaperone&#150;substrate interaction, in vitro complexes of Ssa1p and tritiated Sse1p were incubated with a molar excess of unlabelled Sse1p and/or ATP (Figure 1B).
1|Native Sse1p complexes were purified from a yeast strain with a TAP-tagged SSE1 gene under control of the endogenous promoter (Figure 1A). Two prominent co-isolated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry as Ssa1p and Ssb1p.

1|Both G9A and SUV39H1 could be precipitated with an anti-Gfi1b antibody but not with an irrelevant anti-GST antibody from whole MEL cell extracts (Figure 5B), strongly suggesting a direct physical interaction with Gfi1b and both G9a and SUV39H1 histone methyltransferases at endogenous expression levels.
1|Both G9A and SUV39H1 could be precipitated with an anti-Gfi1b antibody but not with an irrelevant anti-GST antibody from whole MEL cell extracts (Figure 5B)
1|In addition, in the same cells, endogenous Gfi1b could be precipitated with both anti-G9a and anti-SUV39H1 antibodies
1|In vitro kinase assays testing several Hsl1 fragments for direct phosphorylation pointed at the Ser1220 as the Hog1 phosphorylation site in the Hsl1 C-terminal region. Mutation of Ser1220 to Ala abolished phosphorylation of Hsl1 by Hog1 (Figure 6D).
1|In vivo co-precipitation experiments were performed with yeast cells containing a chromosomally HA-tagged Hsl1 or Hsl7 transformed with plasmids that expressed GST-tagged full-length Hog1 or GST control. As shown in Figure 6A, Hog1 is able to interact with Hsl1 but not with Hsl7
1|To test whether various SH3 domains that interact with dynamin were functionally active we used surface plasmon resonance to assess binding to the immobilized PRD of dynamin-2 (Fig. 1; see also [10]). All SH3 domains were active except for the amphiphysin mutant protein specifically designed to lack this property.
1|Furthermore, Cat-1 and -3 were included in the fraction co-immunoprecipitated with NDK-1 using affinity purified NDK-1 antibody (Fig. 5B).
1|The C-terminal domain of NDK-1 was shown to interact with Cat-1 but not Cat-3 (Fig. 5A).
1|Yeast transformed by pGBKT7 fused with the murine p53 protein, and by pGADT7 fused with the SV40 large T antigen were used as positive controls.
1|HEK293 cells were co-transfected with Xpress-tagged Hsp70 and Flag-tagged TRAF6 expression vectors or empty vector respectively, then the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag antibody. The results of immunoblotting analysis using anti-Xpress antibody revealed that Hsp70 obviously interacted with TRAF6 (Fig. 1C). the TRAF-C domain but not the RING finger or zinc finger motif of TRAF6 was required for the interaction of TRAF6 with Hsp70 (Fig. 2B).
1|However, the interaction of Hsp70 and IKK&amp;#947; was not affected by LPS in the present experiment (Fig. 1B).
1|The data revealed that the C-terminal but not the N-terminal of Hsp70 was required for the specific association of Hsp70 with TRAF6 (Fig. 3B).
1|Co-immunoprecipitation showed that endogenous TRAF6 specifically associated with heat-shock-induced Hsp70, but not Hsp90 (Fig. 1B).
1|However, different co-localization patterns according to GA treatment time were noted. Pre-treatment of GA displaced overexpressed HGTD-P to non-mitochondrial sites while co- or post-treatment did not change the mitochondrial localization of HGTD-P (Fig. 4A).
1|In order to demonstrate that HGTD-P interacts with Hsp90 in mammalian cells, HGTD-P was overexpressed in A549 cells by transfection using pcDNA3.1 vectors coding for V5-tagged HGTD-P (HGTD-P-V5). HGTD-P was immunoprecipitated using anti-V5 antibody and the immunoprecipitates were blotted with an anti-Hsp90 antibody. Hsp90 was detected in V5 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1, upper panel). Expression of transfected plasmid or Hsp90 was confirmed by Western blots of cell lysate used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, lower panel).
1|Positive two-hybrid protein interactions were verified by transfection of the plasmids back into the host together with the original bait or with selected controls. DNA sequence analysis of the plasmid insert and computer-assisted database search revealed that the nucleotide sequence of three clones encoded Hsp90 (Accession No. M16660).
1|SOCS3 strongly binds to the LR pY985-motif and negatively regulates LR signalling [18]. To suppress its inhibitory effect on JAK2 activation, we inactivated the Kinase Inhibitory Region (KIR domain) in the SOCS3 prey by introducing a F25A mutation. SV40 large T protein (SVT) was used as negative prey control. As shown in Fig. 2, clear, specific signals were obtained in both Ba/F3 and TF1-M1-16 cells with either the LR(YYF) lacking the Y1138 STAT recruitment motif or with a GGS-bait construct containing only the LR Y985 motif.
1|Strong luciferase signals were detected with the PLC&amp;#947;-prey, and a weaker interaction was seen with the STAT5a-prey (Fig. 3A). Analysis using the GGS-LR Y985 and GGS-LR Y1077 baits revealed that both preys only interact with the Y1077 motif (Fig. 3B).
1|A detailed binding analysis of SOCS preys showed that SOCS3 interacted with the Y985 motif, while SOCS2 and -6 bind to the Y1077 motif. CIS and SOCS7 can interact with both motifs (Fig. 4C).
1|the GST&#150;ALIX fusion protein was able to bind to POSH (Fig. 1A).
1|a full-length POSH cDNA fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain as bait. Sequence analysis of the library inserts revealed two independent clones that contained an open reading frame of a Drosophila homolog of ALG-2.
1|The C-terminal half of ALIX bound to both GST&#150;POSH and GST&#150;ALG-2, whereas the N-terminal half did not bind to either GST fusion protein. These results indicate that the C-terminal half of ALIX containing the proline-rich region is responsible for the binding to both POSH and ALG-2 (Fig. 1C).
1|Furthermore, the GST&#150;ALIX protein was also able to bind to ALG-2, but only in the presence of calcium (Fig. 1B).
1|Both ALG-2 and ALIX co-precipitated with the anti-POSH antibody (Fig. 1D).
1|In addition, talin also bound to GST&#150;SibB, GST&#150;SibC,GST&#150;SibD and GST&#150;SibE (Fig 2).

1|radioiodinated skeletal muscle &amp;#945;-dystroglycan bound to laminin-8 and laminin-10/11 with lower activity compared to laminin-1 (Fig. 3A).
1|We also tested binding of the FGFR2 fragment to the FGL peptide (Fig. 2C), previously shown to bind FGFR1 [6]. The FGL peptide corresponds to a binding site for FGFR1 in NCAM (the FG loop region of the NCAM F3 module 2). The calculated Kd value for the FGFR2-FGL interaction was very similar to that for the FGFR1-FGL interaction (see Table 1).
1|Therefore, binding of the immobilized FGFR2 Ig modules 2&#150;3 to soluble NCAM F3 modules 1&#150;2 was studied by SPR (Fig. 2A). In order to determine the Kd value of the NCAM&#150;FGFR2 interaction, the equilibrium binding level of the F3 modules was plotted versus the concentration of the F3 modules in solution and fitted with an equation describing the single-site receptor&#150;ligand equilibrium binding (Fig. 2B).In comparison to the NCAM&#150;FGFR1 binding, the NCAM&#150;FGFR2 binding is characterized by much faster association and dissociation phases and approximately the same affinity. A detailed comparison of the kinetic parameters for the two interactions is shown in Table 1.
1|To test if the FGFR2 fragment was expressed in a functionally active form, the protein was immobilized on the surface of a CM-5 sensor chip, and its binding to FGF1 was studied by SPR and compared to that of the corresponding FGFR1 fragment.
1|We found that &amp;#945;-actinin2 was co-immunoprecipitated well with the wild-type NR2B subunit, but very little with Y1472FNR2B (Supplementary Figure 5A). We found that the more Tyr-1472 was phosphorylated, the more &amp;#945;-actinin2 was associated with the NR2B subunit(Supplementary Figure 5C), suggesting that the Tyr-1472-phosphorylated NR2B subunit was tightly associated with the actin cytoskeleton via &amp;#945;-actinin2.
1|We found that the AP-2 complex was co-immunoprecipitated well with the wild-type NR2B subunit, but very little with Y1472FNR2B in the brain (Supplementary Figure 5A).
1|PSD-95, another regulator of NMDAR localization at synapses (Allison et al, 1998), was co-immunoprecipitated well with both the wild-type NR2B subunit and Y1472FNR2B (Supplementary Figure 5A).
1|Conversely, the more Tyr-1472 was phosphorylated, the less AP-2 complex became associated with the NR2B subunit (Supplementary Figure 5C). Thus, neither the Tyr-1472 phosphorylated NR2B subunit nor Y1472FNR2B interacted well with the AP-2 complex (Supplementary Figure 5A and 5C).
1|We immunoprecipitated NMDARs from the amygdala with an antibody against the NR2B subunit and probed for the levels of co-immunoprecipitated NMDAR-associated proteins. Among these molecules, we found that CaMKII, an essential molecule for the induction of NMDAR-dependent LTP in the amygdala (Bayer et al, 2001; Lisman et al, 2002; Rodrigues et al, 2004), was almost absent from the NMDAR complex in YF/YF mice (Figure 5A).

1|We crystallized the His6-tagged human CHP2 (1&#150;196) complexed with its binding domain (aa 503&#150;545) in NHE1
1|We determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal Ring containing fragments of coexpressed Ring1b159/Bmi1109 that was active in histone H2A ubiquitination.
1|Coprecipitation and immunoblot studies confirmed that Sws1 associates with Rlp1 and Rdl1 in vivo and further showed that Rdl1 coprecipitates with Rlp1 (Figure 6C), indicating that the three proteins form a stable complex.
1|We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with the C-terminal 187 amino acids of S. pombe Srs2, which is the region responsible for its interaction with Rhp51 (our unpublished results), the Rad51 homolog in fission yeast. One of the hits was SPBC11B10.06, a gene listed as a sequence orphan with a SWIM domain (Figure 1A).
1|Both SWS1 and XRCC2 were detected in immunoprecipitates of RAD51D (Figure 8A).
1|Despite significant sequence similarity (not, vert, similar75%) between human UbL-hHR23A and UbL-hHR23B (hereafter termed UbL-A and UbL-B), only the latter bound the yeast proteasome (lane 6).
1|We confirmed a strong interaction between the proteasome and the UbL domain from yeast Rad23 (Fig. 1, lane 1).
1|The bound proteins were resolved by SDS&#150;PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and the immunoblots reacted with antibodies against vimentin. Consistent with the proteomic analysis, a predominant interaction was observed with UbL-B (Fig. 4B; lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, incubation with antibodies against translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), showed strong interaction with UbL-A, but significantly reduced binding to UbL-B (Fig. 4B; lanes 1 and 2).
1|Consistent with results described in Fig. 4B, we found that Isopeptidase T was only purified with GST-UbL-B (Panel C).
1|Furthermore, the inhibition of proteasome binding by the lysine mutation (similar to lysine-7 in yeast Rad23), also indicates that this mutation does not alter structure, since interaction with Ataxin-3 was unaffected.
1|In contrast, UbL-B was purified with Isopeptidase T, fragments of BRCA1, and various forms of the structural protein vimentin. BRCA1 is targeted for degradation by the Ub/proteasome pathway [20] and [21], and BRCA2 has been reported to be ubiquitinated [22].
1|Consistent with previous results, mutation of the residue corresponding to lysine-7 in yeast Rad23 abolished proteasome binding by both human UbL-A and UbL-B (Fig. 3C; lanes 6 and 7),
1|A subset of candidate proteasome (or UbL) binding proteins is shown (Fig. 4A; lanes 6 and 7). UbL-A precipitated Ub-activating enzyme (E1), translation elongation factors (eEF1A and EF2), and fragments of BRCA2 (lane 6). Significant levels of the stress-inducible factor Hsp71 were also detected in association with UbL-A.
0|The UbL domain of yeast Dsk2 showed weak interaction, consistent with previous findings [17].
0|In contrast, low levels of E1 were detected with both UbL domains.
1|we tested several TTR mutants and mouse TTR for non-glycosylated RAGE binding. Among these human mutants, L55P significantly lost a competition effect, showing not, vert, similar10-fold lower affinities to both human (Fig. 1A) and mouse (data not shown) sRAGE, as compared to human wtTTR.
1|Indeed, 125I-TTR bound to the RAGE peptide in a dose-dependent, specific and saturable manner, with a Kd = 91 &#177; 44 nM (Fig. 2A).
0|These protein fragments bind specifically to Sir4-CC and fail to bind underivatized plates or a Sir4-CC(M1307N) point mutant that does not interact with full-length Sir3
0|Sir3 residues 464&#150;522 are essential, but apparently not sufficient, for the interaction with Sir4. We conclude that Sir3-(464&#150;728) is the minimal domain of Sir3 that stably interacts with Sir4.
0|The efficient association of Sir3-(832&#150;978) with both Sir3 fragments shows that the dimerization function of Sir3 is mediated by C-terminal residues 832&#150;978 and Sir4-binding residues 464&#150;728.
0|Both subunits of the Sir3 dimer are required to stabilize the complex with the Sir4 coiled-coil.
0|Thus, the Sir4-CC domain alone or in complex with Sir3-(464&#150;978) assembles into higher order protein arrays in the absence of DNA, albeit at high protein concentrations.
1|The physical interaction between SCP2 and AR was examined using glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, mammalian two-hybrid protein&#150;protein interaction assays, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. These in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the bacterial two-hybrid results that SCP2 is capable of direct interaction with AR (Supplementary Figures S1A, B and C).
1|The cDNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal sequence of SCP2 (amino-acid residues 90&#150;283) was detected twice in the screen. The physical interaction between SCP2 and AR was examined using glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, mammalian two-hybrid protein&#150;protein interaction assays, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. These in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the bacterial two-hybrid results that SCP2 is capable of direct interaction with AR (Supplementary Figures S1A, B and C).
1|T pull-down performed with increasing amount of NSF in the presence of non-hydrolysable ATPgammaS (to inhibit ATPase activity) demonstrated a direct binding of NSF to GBR2ct (Figure 2A).
0|Interestingly, Pep27 was as efficient as a previously described 10 amino-acid peptide corresponding to the GluR2 NSF binding site (Pep2m)
1|mmunoprecipitation of GBR1 or GBR2 from cell expressing each of the receptor individually led to the co-sedimentation of NSF (Figure 3A and B).
1|A yeast two-hybrid screen (YTH) was performed with both GBR1 and GBR2 full-length c-tails (860I-961K and 741I-941L, respectively) against a human brain cDNA library. In addition to complementary GBR subunit (White et al, 2002) and transcription factor ATFx/CREB2 (White et al, 2000), we found NSF as a potential binding partner of GBR2 (Figure 1).
1|Figure 4 NSF co-localizes with both GBR subunits at the plasma membrane.
0|GBR1/GBR2 heterodimerization does not interfere with the NSF/GBR1 interaction.
1|In contrast to the results obtained in YTH experiments, NSF binding was not found to be restricted to GBR2ct and GBR1ct (854I-961K) also interacted selectively with NSF (Figure 2D).
1|Figure 4 NSF co-localizes with both GBR subunits at the plasma membrane.
1|By using anti-TCF-4 antibody, a robust coisolation of TCF-4 with wild-type HIC1, and with HIC1-DCtBP, was obtained from lysates of human 293 cells;
1|Using anti-GFP antibody, we coimmunoprecipitated b-catenin, HIC1 and TCF-4 in one complex from 293 cells (Figure 6C).
1|However, HIC1 sequestered endogenous b-catenin and TCF-4 into the nuclear HIC1 bodies
1|Cotransfection of the full-length HIC1 construct results in complete relocation of CtBP1 into the nuclear HIC1 bodies
1|In CtBP-positive COS-7 cells, TCF-4 was efficiently sequestered into the HIC1 bodies (Figure 2B).
1|The direct binding between TCF-4 and HIC1 was studied in vitro by pull-down assays between bacterially expressed GST-tagged TCF-4 and in vitro translated HIC1.
1|we detected association of EGFPtagged HIC1 and TCF-4 in both CtBP-negative and CtBP1- positive cells
1|Furthermore, we immunoprecipitated the endogenous HIC1/TCF-4 complexes from whole-cell lysates prepared from mouse embryos on day 12.5 p.c.
1|From MS, three main species could be detected (Fig 1B). The largest component is consistent with the trimer Mud13-CBP:Sto1:Srp1. In addition, a dimer Mud13-CBP:Sto1 was detected, as well as Sto1 alone
1|We used a Dcs2 TAP fusion and, after optimization of the TAP protocol, mass spectra showed only one principal species, consistent with the heterodimer Dcs1:Dcs2-CBP, where CBP refers to the tag remaining after cleavage with the tobacco etch virus protease
1|HA-TCTP co-precipitated both 100 kDa Na,K-ATPase &amp;#945; subunit and 50 kDa SNX6 (Fig. 1C).
1|We also performed immunoprecipitation with untrasfected HeLa cells to see if endogenous TCTP and SNX6 are complexed with Na,K-ATPase. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Na,K-ATPase antibody detected 50 kDa SNX6 and 23 kDa TCTP (Fig. 1D), suggesting that TCTP associates with SNX6 as well as Na,K-ATPase, and their complex exists in HeLa cells.
1|we searched for TCTP-binding proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. Using this approach, we were able to isolate several cDNA clones. One of these clones corresponded to the gene for SNX6 which encodes 406 amino acids (Fig. 1A).Fig. 1B, which shows the results of &amp;#946;-galactosidase activity assay, suggests that the interaction between TCTP and SNX6 occurred inside the yeast cell, and between TCTP and the third cytoplasmic domain of Na,K-ATPase &amp;#945;1 subunit (&amp;#945;1CD3).
1|[14C]glucosylation of GST-Rac1 by TcdB was analysed in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4). The level of Rac1 apparently decreased when analysed by anti-Rac1 (Mab 102); this decrease correlated with increasing [14C]glucosylation of Rac1 as visualised by PhosphorImaging (Fig. 4).

1|We next examined the ability of GAG-modified NRP1 to associate with VEGFR2 in the presence of VEGF by co-immunoprecipitation. After pretreatment with heparitinase and/or chondroitinase, V5-tagged VEGFR2 was precipitated from SMC lysates in the presence of VEGF. As shown in Figure 4E, CS-modified NRP1 minimally associated with VEGFR2 compared to non-modified or HS-modified NRP1.
1|we measured the binding of 125I-labeled VEGF to FLAG-tagged NRP1 in these cells. After incubation with 125I-labeled VEGF, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and bound radioactivity was counted. NRP1 WT\&apos; bound VEGF with 3.87- and 2.27-fold higher than NRP1 S612A in SMCs and ECs, respectively (Figure 3B).
1|We confirmed that addition of FLAG tag to NRP1 does not affect VEGF binding (data not shown) and that the mutation itself (NRP1 S612A) did not change VEGF binding to the core protein of NRP1 (Figure 2E).
1|When human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs) were incubated with 125I-labeled VEGF, we detected two distinct binding proteins after cell-surface crosslinking (Figure 1A).
1|In kidney, CaBP28K and TRPV5 colocalized in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and the connecting tubule (CNT) (Figure 1A).
1|CaBP28K bound to both the N- and C-termini of TRPV5 and TRPV6 in the absence of Ca2+ (5 mM EDTA), whereas the binding was virtually abolished in the presence of Ca2+ (1 mM CaCl2) (Figure 1D).  In addition, pull-down analysis demonstrated that CaBP28KDeltaEF binds in the absence (5 mM EDTA) as well as presence (1 mM CaCl2) of Ca2+ to the N- and C-terminus of both TRPV5 and TRPV6 (Figure 4B).
1|To investigate whether CaBP28KDeltaEF competes with wild-type CaBP28K for TRPV5 binding, increasing amounts of non-radioactive in vitro-translated CaBP28KDeltaEF were added during the pull-down assay. This resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of CaBP28K binding, indicating that CaBP28KDeltaEF competed with wild-type CaBP28K for TRPV5 association (Figure 4C).
1|TRPV5 co-precipitated with GST-CaBP28K in cells that were treated with BAPTA-AM, whereas the channel was not precipitated from non-treated cells (Figure 1E).
1|Indeed, our hypothesis was confirmed by the fact that RSK physically associated with ERK under overexpressed (Figure 5B) or endogenous (Figure 5C) conditions. Moreover, ERKSem (ERKD334N) and RSKR902A mutants failed to bind RSK and ERK, respectively (Figures 5B and 6C, respectively).
1|As expected, RSKKR was completely incapable of phosphorylating its substrate (transphosphorylation) as well as the kinase itself (autophosphorylation), while RSKWT was capable of performing both phosphorylating activities (Figure 6D), showing that RSKKR is indeed catalytically inactive.
1|Indeed, our hypothesis was confirmed by the fact that RSK physically associated with ERK under overexpressed (Figure 5B) or endogenous (Figure 5C) conditions.
1|Like pol iota, pol eta appears to interact with Ub (Figure 1D). Neither the p125 or p66 subunit of poldelta interacts with Ub, but as expected, the p66 subunit interacts with PCNA (Figure 1D; Hughes et al, 1999). The interaction of poliota and poleta with Ub is therefore specific and at least in the two-hybrid system, does not extend to SUMO-1. We believe that SUMO-1 is active under our assay conditions, as we were able to detect an interaction between SUMO-1 and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) (Baba et al, 2005; Figure 1D).  Interestingly, a single H654A substitution in one of the conserved histidine residue of the C2H2 motif abolishes the interaction between poleta and Ub (Figure 5A).
1|Using an N-terminal GST-fusion of full-length wild-type poliota, or the poliota P692R mutant, we then performed pull-down assays with PCNA or His-Ub-PCNA. Both poliota and poliota P692R are able to bind to unmodified PCNA (Figure 6B, left panel).
1|by employing the yeast two-hybrid assay and various deletion constructs of poleta, we mapped the Ub-binding site to a region spanning poleta residues 587&#150;641 (Supplementary Figure S2). This region contains a conserved C2H2 or so-called \\&apos;Zinc-finger\\&apos; motif (Vaisman et al, 2004).
1|Furthermore, by using a series of poliota deletion mutants, we mapped the region of the Ub-interaction to the C-terminal 224 amino acids of poliota (Figure 1C).
1|It is not surprising, therefore, that a GST-fusion corresponding to the C-terminal 130 amino acids of poleta (poleta-[581&#150;713]) can pull-down both unmodified PCNA (Figure 6D, left panel) and Ub-PCNA (Figure 6D, right panel).
1|Like pol iota, pol eta appears to interact with Ub (Figure 1D). Neither the p125 or p66 subunit of poldelta interacts with Ub, but as expected, the p66 subunit interacts with PCNA (Figure 1D; Hughes et al, 1999). The interaction of poliota and poleta with Ub is therefore specific and at least in the two-hybrid system, does not extend to SUMO-1. We believe that SUMO-1 is active under our assay conditions, as we were able to detect an interaction between SUMO-1 and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) (Baba et al, 2005; Figure 1D).
1|e used human poliota as a bait to screen a human testis cDNA library in the yeast two-hybrid system. Approximately 25&#150;30% of the clones that were found to interact with poliota encoded the UbA52 or UbB ubiquitin precursor proteins (Figure 1A and B).
1|As seen in Figure 2B, in the absence of any Ub-conjugating proteins, poliota and poleta preferentially interact with both K48- and K63-linked polyUb 4&#150;7 chains. while peptides encompassing P692 were able to pull-down both K48- and K63-linked polyUb chains, a peptide with the P692R substitution was unable to pull-down either form of Ub chain (Figure 3B).
1|We were therefore interested in assaying the ability of both wild-type poliota and poleta and their respective Ub-binding mutants to interact with Ub-PCNA in vitro. To do so, we first generated His-tagged Ub-PCNA in vitro following the protocol recently described for the ubiquitination of S. cerivisiae PCNA by Garg and Burgers (2005) (Supplementary Figure S3A and Supplementary Materials and Methods). As expected from earlier studies (Hoege et al, 2002), the His-Ub is conjugated to PCNA via K164, since a K164R PCNA mutant could not be ubiquitinated under the same assay conditions in vitro (Supplementary Figure S3B).
1|As seen in Figure 2B, in the absence of any Ub-conjugating proteins, poliota and poleta preferentially interact with both K48- and K63-linked polyUb 4&#150;7 chains. we used full-length C-terminal His-tagged poleta or poleta-H654A and assayed the ability of each to bind Ub. As shown in Figure 5B, the wild-type protein clearly binds K48- and K63-linked polyUb chains. In contrast, the H654A poleta mutant protein is unable to bind either form of polyUb.
1|Using pull-downs from A549 cell lysates, that the N-terminal E1A binding proteins S8, TBP and Ran all bind w.t. 12S E1A but do not bind L1920A-12S E1A (Figure 1A, compare lanes 2 and 3).
1|Using pull-downs from A549 cell lysates, that the N-terminal E1A binding proteins S8, TBP and Ran all bind w.t. 12S E1A but do not bind L1920A-12S E1A (Figure 1A, compare lanes 2 and 3).  TBP had a similar propensity to bind these same CR3 mutant proteins (Supplementary Figure S1A).
1|Significantly, immunoprecipitation studies revealed that relative to w.t. 13S E1A, L1920A-13S E1A retained appreciable binding capacity for S8 (Figure 1B) and TBP (Figure 1C), indicating that these proteins bind CR3 specifically, in vivo.
1|Using pull-downs from A549 cell lysates, that the N-terminal E1A binding proteins S8, TBP and Ran all bind w.t. 12S E1A but do not bind L1920A-12S E1A (Figure 1A, compare lanes 2 and 3). we next determined, by GST pull-down, the binding site within CR3 for S8. These experiments revealed that the S8 binding site extends from amino acid 169 to 188 (Figure 2A, upper panel).
1|Immunoprecipitation revealed that 19S base components are found associated with E1A in 13S-L1920A A549 cells (Figure 4C, upper panel). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation similarly revealed the association of 19S base components S2 and S10b with E1A (Figure 4C, lower panel).
1|(Figure 6A). Serum stimulation strongly enhanced the interaction between eIF4B and eIF3 in cells expressing wt and constitutively active RSK variants (lanes 2 and 8, 3.5- and 7.5-fold, respectively), but not in cells expressing the kinase-dead RSK (lane 5).
1|Immunocomplex kinase assays were then carried out with recombinant eIF4B as a substrate in vitro. Wt (but not kinase-dead) RSK elicited a 3.5-fold increase in eIF4B phosphorylation (Figure 4A), indicating that RSK, but not a co-purifying kinase activity, is responsible for the phosphorylation.
1|ing GST-pulldowns, we first tested whether rat brain rabphilin binds to SNARE proteins. We found that GST-SNAP-25 efficiently captured rabphilin, whereas GST-synaptobrevin and GST-syntaxin did not (Figure 1A).
1|We found that brain and recombinant SNAP-25 were equally efficiently retained by GST-rabphilins (Figure 1B), indicating a direct interaction.
1|We immunoprecipitated rabphilin from rat brain homogenates under conditions that favor SNARE complex assembly, and probed for co-immunoprecipitated proteins by immunoblotting. We found that SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1 were co-immunoprecipitated with rabphilin, whereas synaptophysin and GDI were not (Figure 1D).

0|Interaction of HIF-1a with TSGA10.
1|To further examine the protein&#150;protein interaction between TSGA10 and HIF-1a in vivo, double-immunofluorescence studies were performed in human spermatozoa. As shown in Fig. 3B, HIF-1a and TSGA10 co-localize in the flagellum.
1|To verify the interaction of mHIF-1aI.1 and TSGA10 by pull-down assays, we purified TSGA10 aa 556&#150;688 from bacteria as a MBP-fusion protein. In the following MBP-pulldown, V5-tagged in vitro translated mHIF-1aI.1 aa 1&#150;401 specifically interacted with MBP-TSGA10 aa 556&#150;688
1|Strong beta-galactosidase activities were measured with fragments that contain LXMs, but not in case of the fragment corresponding to amino acids 648&#150;948 of CNOT1 that does not contain an LXM, or the LexA DNA-binding domain only (Figure 4B).
1|To confirm that CNOT1 is a component of the human Ccr4-Not complex, we used these antibodies, and antibodies recognizing the CNOT2 and CNOT8/CALIF subunits, for immunoprecipitation analysis (Figure 1B). As expected, these proteins are part of a complex that also includes CNOT3 indicating that CNOT1 is the human orthologue of yeast Not1p.
1|Surprisingly, a ligand-independent interaction was observed between the N-terminal region of CNOT1 and full-length TRbeta (Figure 7B).
1|nterestingly, CNOT1 did not display such interactions with RARalpha, TRbeta, and PPARgamma (Figure 7A&#150;C), but did interact in a ligand-dependent fashion with RXRalpha (Figure 7D).
1|To explore GPR50 heterodimerization with MT1 and MT2, GPR50-YFP was coexpressed with the N-terminally Flag-tagged MT1 and Myc-tagged MT2. Anti-GFP antibodies were indeed able to specifically pull down MT1 and MT2 proteins (Figure 1C and D).
1|Gialpha was also observed in co-immunoprecipitates from GPR50-YFP- and GPR50DeltaCter-YFP-containing cell lysates (Figure 9A, lanes 2 and 3). At comparable receptor levels, the amount of Gialpha associated with GPR50-YFP was lower compared to MT1-YFP lysates and even lower for GPR50DeltaCter-YFP.
1|Cell lysates containing equivalent quantities of YFP fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated and the presence of Gialpha was revealed by Western blotting. Gialpha was readily co-precipitated from melatonin-stimulated MT1-YFP-containing cell lysates (Figure 9A, lane 1).
1|The GPR50-Rluc construct was used as BRET donor and was coexpressed with the BRET acceptor YFP fused to the C-terminus of different receptors (Figure 2A). Significant energy transfer was observed in cells coexpressing GPR50-Rluc with similar amounts of GPR50-YFP, MT1-YFP or MT2-YFP.
1|GPR50-YFP itself localized to the cell membrane when expressed alone or with Flag-MT1 (Figure 7B, D and G).
1|Dynamic recruitment of beta-arrestin 1 to MT1 was observed upon melatonin stimulation of cells coexpressing MT1-Rluc and an N-terminally YFP-tagged beta-arrestin 1 fusion protein (Figure 9B).
1|To confirm GPR50 homodimerization, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with differentially tagged receptors. When immunoprecipitating GPR50-YFP, co-precipitated Flag-GPR50 was revealed in SDS&#150;PAGE as a monomer at 70 kDa and as a SDS-resistant dimer at 140 kDa (Figure 1B).
1|GST-Sho1 constructs without an activating mutation bound the HA-tagged Ste11 N-terminal domain (HA-Ste11N) (Figure 5D, lanes 15&#150;17). In contrast, constructs with an activating mutation, namely GST-Sho1Delta1-R342G, GST-Sho1Delta2-R342G, and GST-Sho1Delta1-G346S, did strongly bind HA-Ste11N (Figure 5D, lanes 18&#150;20).
1|More stable binding was observed when either the R342G or G346S mutation was included in the Sho1 SH3 domain (Figure 5D, lanes 11&#150;13). Deletion of the Sho1 residues 145&#150;218 weakened the Ste50 binding significantly (lane 12).
1|As shown in Figure 5D (left panel), either GST-Ste50-D146F or GST-Ste50Delta1-D146F co-precipitated HA-Sho1C (lanes 4 and 5), while the wild-type GST-Ste50 or GST-Ste50Delta1 did not (lanes 2 and 3). GST-Ste50Delta4, which lacks the SAM and the central conserved domains, also did not bind HA-Sho1C. This pattern, as well as the location of the activating D146F mutation, suggests that the central conserved domain is important for Ste50&#150;Sho1 binding.
1|The wild-type Sho1 weakly bound to Ste11N, whereas the two SH3 domain mutants (R342G and G346S) bound to Ste11N more strongly (Figure 6A).

1|GST is itself a dimer and we verified that the GST-CHK2-KD fusion protein is also strongly dimeric (Figure 5B).
1|t all concentrations of the crosslinker, we observed a consistent crosslinked dimer band, but with no significant higher bands that would indicate nonspecific aggregation of the protein at this concentration, suggesting that CHK2-KD does exist in a monomer&#150;dimer equilibrium in solution (Figure 5A).
1|Both constructs showed some ability to autophosphorylate on incubation with gamma-32P-labelled ATP (Figure 5C and D); however, consistent with our model, the GST-fused kinase was at least four-fold more active in autophosphorylation than the isolated kinase domain.
1|when YopOhis full-length was cross-linked with SycO, a high molecular mass complex was detected by the &amp;#945;-YopO antibodies (Fig S2B).
1|Cross-linking led to a shift in the apparent molecular mass of SycO from 17 kDa to 55 kDa suggesting that YopO200 was associated with two molecules of SycO (Fig S2A).
1|We monitored the autophosphorylating activity of the purified kinase (Galyov et al, 1993), with and without the CBD. As a negative control, we engineered an inactive GST-YopO hybrid with the D267A substitution in the catalytic site (Juris et al, 2000). As expected, the kinase activity was dependent on the presence of actin (Juris et al, 2000) (Figure 3). Importantly, YopODelta20&#150;77 was at least as active as GST-YopO (Figure 3), showing that the CBD is not needed for the catalytic activity of YopO.
1|we constructed a GST-YopO hybrid, a variant where residues 20&#150;77 of YopO were deleted (GST-YopODelta22&#150;77) and a hybrid containing only residues 20&#150;77 of YopO (GST-YopO20&#150;77). All three hybrid proteins were expressed in parallel in Y. enterocolitica E40. SycO was pulled down together with GST-YopO and with GST-YopO20&#150;77 but not with GST-YopODelta20&#150;77 (Figure 2C).

1|In the absence of B-Raf, PKCalt epsilon still associated with S6K2. However, B-Raf failed to associate with S6K2 in the absence of PKCalt epsilon (Figure 3B
1|When activated B-Raf (V600EB-Raf) was coincubated with S6K2 no phosphorylation of S6K2 was seen, although in parallel experiments V600EB-Raf could efficiently phosphorylated MEK (Figure 3D lower panel).
1|This suggests that while PKCalt epsilon association to S6K2 could be direct, B-Raf association to S6K2 requires PKCalt epsilon. In agreement with this, FGF-2 only induced association of B-Raf with S6K2 in the KO+alt epsilon but not KO cells (Figure 3C).

1|Using a coimmunoprecipitation assay, the interaction between endogenous Daxx and Mdm2 was detected in several of the human cell lines examined, regardless of the status of p53
1|The Daxx&#150;Mdm2 interaction is likely to be direct, as shown by an in vitro pulldown assay with recombinant proteins
1|HeLa S3 lysates were incubated with M2 beads (control) or M2 beads coated with recombinant Flag&#150;Daxx. The bound proteins were resolved on SDS&#150;PAGE and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. The 135 K protein band in the Flag&#150;Daxx lane was identified as Hausp by mass spectrometry

1|The interaction between endogenous Daxx and Hausp was verified using both a coimmunoprecipitation assay with anti-Daxx (Fig. 3b) and a reciprocal assay with anti-Hausp antibodies
1|Deletion analyses revealed two regions in Daxx that associate with Hausp: the N-terminal 160 amino acids, which contain the first paired amphipathic helix domain (PAH1), and amino acids 347&#150;570, which encompass the acid-rich region
1|The disruption of the binary Mdm2&#150; Daxx interaction by DNA-damage signals seemed to be persistent and was not restored 4 h after treatment with etoposide (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S4b), whereas the binary Daxx&#150;Hausp interaction was partially recovered by this time (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S4c). In contrast, the Daxx&#150;p53 interaction was affected to a lesser extent

1|A GST fusion fragment of FilGAP encompassing amino acids 96-395 stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of both Cdc42 and Rac1
1|Colocalisation of FilGAP and FLNa in lamellae of A7 cells is indicated in the merged image (yellow).
1|To determine whether or not ROCK phosphorylates FilGAP in vitro, recombinant ROCK was incubatd with purified full-length FilGAP protein.
1|PP1d and MYPT-1 were co-precipitated with endogenous merlin from lysates of both RT4 and NIH 3T3 cells
1|MYPT-1 preferred the phosphorylated form of merlin, because fulllength S518D or wild type merlin compared to S518A merlin coprecipitated with MYPT-1
1|The Coomassie-stained gel also revealed a band at a molecular mass of about 130 kDa, which by immunoblot was identified as MYPT-1
