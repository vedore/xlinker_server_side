# NCBITextLib #

NCBITextLib is a simple but effective software library that allows one
to build and access an infrastructure for large-scale text mining tasks.
This library only provides basic C++ classes for building various text
mining tools. Since the library provides a simple to use interface for
connecting an internal text data structure to other high-level
applications, it is straightforward to build ML software upon
NCBITextLib. Currently, we provide three machine learning classes (naive
Bayes, support vector machine and theme analysis algorithms) and example
codes that use NCBITextLib.

## Tested System ##

- g++ (gcc) 4.8.1
- OS: CentOS release 6.7

## How to Use ##

1. Download
  * git clone https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/NCBITextLib.git

2. Building a library
  * cd ./lib
  * make

3. Compiling example programs
  * cd ./applications
  * make [file name], e.g. make make_db

4. Machine learing classes and examples
  * cd ./applications
  * BayeX.h: naive Bayes classifier (inherit from CMark)
  * HubeX.h: support vector machine classifier (inherit from CMark)
  * ThemX.h: theme analysis algorithm (inherit from BayeX)
  * make_doc: create a Doc from samples.txt
  * make_xpost: create a XPost from a Doc set (should run make_doc and make_xpost beforhand for other applications)
  * run_BayeX: naive Bayes classifier example
  * run_HubeX: support vector machine classifier example
  * run_ThemX: theme analysis algorithm example
  * find_neighbors: find neighboring documents from a seed document

NOTE: sample programs use XPost, thus should run make_doc and make_xpost beforehand.
